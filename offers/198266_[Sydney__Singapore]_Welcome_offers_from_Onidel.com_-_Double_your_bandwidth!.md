# [Sydney / Singapore] Welcome offers from Onidel.com - Double your bandwidth!
**Link:** [Original Thread](https://lowendtalk.com/discussion/198266/sydney-singapore-welcome-offers-from-onidel-com-double-your-bandwidth)

Hello folks,

We're excited to introduce ourselves on LowEndTalk! We're a small, Australia-based business specialising in cloud and hosting infrastructure. While we've been in business for nearly two years, our focus has been on cloud network design and server management for local and international clients, primarily in developing markets.

About a year ago, we began developing our own control panel to deliver even more value to our customers. Our goal is to become a trusted cloud provider for enthusiasts, developers, and SMBs. Today, we're officially launching with our deals here on LET!

We strive to offer high-quality service at a fair price. While we may not be the cheapest, we believe you'll be satisfied with the value we provide. Here are a few key highlights:

* **Data Centers in APAC**: Singapore (Racks Central), Sydney (Equinix SY3), and Vietnam (FPT Fornix HCM01), with plans for further expansion.
* **We Own Our Infrastructure**: Including hardware, ASN, and IPv4/IPv6 prefixes. We are APNIC member.
* **Powerful Hardware**: Our hypervisor nodes run on AMD EPYC Milan with Enterprise NVMe Gen4 storage.
* **Network Reliability**: IP transit through Host Universal in Singapore and Sydney, with a fully redundant network setup.
* **Block Storage**: Ceph-powered with NVMe SSD.
* **IPv6 Ready**: Fully supported routed IPv6.
* **KVM + QEMU Virtualisation**.
* **Custom Control Panel**: Offering advanced features like **Cloud Firewall**, **automatic backups** (paid add-on), **2 free snapshots per account**, **custom ISO**, **private networks**, and basic **team management**.
* **Flexible Resources**: Customize CPU, RAM, and storage to fit your needs—no rigid, fixed plans.
