# Hello AMD! Hello IPv6! We've got some new offers for you!
**Link:** [Original Thread](https://lowendtalk.com/discussion/211054/hello-amd-hello-ipv6-weve-got-some-new-offers-for-you)

*We welcome IPv6 and EPYC to our network!*
==========================================

### *AMD EPYC 7003 series cpus*

Our new AMD EPYC Milan plans offer **better disk I/O**, **faster memory speed**, and **higher computational efficiency per cycle**.

### *IPv6 Networking*

Phase 1 of our IPv6 rollout is complete and now available in the following data centers:

* **Las Vegas, Nevada:** IPv6 to be enabled by *mid November*
* **Singapore:** IPv6 is enabled, including via the **SGIX peering exchange**
* **Silicon Valley, California:** IPv6 is enabled

You can also request a **routed /56 or /64 subnet** to point to your virtual server’s IPv6 interface. This feature is **fully automated** in our portal and included **at no additional cost**.

✅ Double bandwidth offer!
-------------------------

We are also reposting your favorite sizes from our previous offers, bringing back our double bandwidth promotion!

Just post your order number in this thread and our team will double your bandwidth at no additional cost!

Got YABS for AMD?
-----------------

We sure do! Please read these notes though:

> Network "speed test" results vary by location, based on latency due to distance or how busy these public iperf servers may be at the time...
>
> Network port is limited to 1.2gbps for sending, but not for receiving and disk I/O is limited to 1.2GB/s in order to minimize "bad neighbor" issues.
>
> Note: "VM type" is KVM, but due to Hyper-V enlightenments , YABS detects it as Microsoft virtualization.

> All newly deployed virtual servers include one IPv6 address on a dedicated network port. This port is disabled by default. To enable it, visit <https://portal.serverpoint.com>, click the **gear ⚙️** next to your server, and open the **Info / IP** tab to manage IPv6 settings. Additional notes: GeoIP data for our IPv6 subnets is still spreading through GeoIP databases and will take some weeks. In addition, reverse DNS management for IPv6 is a manual process at this time; please contact our tech team for an IPv6 DNS entry.
