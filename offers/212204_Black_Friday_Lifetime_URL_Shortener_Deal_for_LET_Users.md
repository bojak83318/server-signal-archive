# Black Friday: Lifetime URL Shortener Deal for LET Users
**Link:** [Original Thread](https://lowendtalk.com/discussion/212204/black-friday-lifetime-url-shortener-deal-for-let-users)

Hi everyone,

We recently launched a new project called [**S.EE**](https://s.ee/), a privacy-focused URL shortener and analytics platform designed for professionals and teams. For this Black Friday, we are introducing a special promo for the LET community:

**Lifetime plan for only 59 USD**

No renewal, no subscription, full access forever. Valid until **2025-12-15**.

---

### What does the Lifetime plan include

* 200 short links per month
* 200 QR codes per month
* 20 GB storage, 5 GB max file size
* 1 custom domain
* 1 year analytics retention
* 2 team members
* Password protection
* A/B testing
* Full API access
* Priority support

---

### Exclusive for LET and LEB

We registered two branded domains for the LET community. Both are strictly whitelisted:

| Domain | Allowed links |
| --- | --- |
| **lowend.talk** | Only for **lowendtalk.com** URLs |
| **lowend.box** | Only for **lowendbox.com** URLs |

They cannot be used to shorten any external or unrelated domains, which prevents abuse and keeps them aligned with their intended communities.

Users may enable either of them in their S.EE account if they want LET or LEB branded links.

---

### Why S.EE

Many URL shorteners focus on marketing funnels rather than control and privacy. S.EE was built differently:

* No tracking pixels or junk scripts
* No reliance on Google Analytics or third-party ad networks
* Self-hosted Plausible analytics
* EU-hosted infrastructure

---

### Who is it suitable for

* Hosting providers posting coupons and links
* Review sites that need analytics insight
* Affiliates managing campaigns with A/B testing
* Community members who need clean short URLs without ads

---

### Multiple Short Domains Available

If you do not want to use or purchase your own custom domain, S.EE also offers a pool of short domains ready to use. Some examples:

* `u.nu`
* `s.lu`
* `s.tt`

And many more. Users are welcome to explore and pick the one that suits their identity or campaign style.

### API for Developers

S.EE includes a [REST API](https://s.ee/docs/developers/) that allows programmatic creation and management of short URLs. It is suitable for deployments where links are generated by scripts or tools instead of manually in the dashboard.

For existing Yourls users, we provide a compatibility mode so current scripts can work without modification.

Docs: <https://s.ee/docs/developers/api/create-short-url-simple-mode/>

---

### Free URL Shortener for Open Source Projects

We also operate a permanently free shortener for developers and OSS maintainers: **ba.sh**

Website: <https://app.ba.sh/>

It is tailored for technical workflows and supports shortening links from **github.com** and **gitlab.com**, which makes it suitable for installation scripts, CI/CD pipelines, documentation, and release announcements.

No registration is required.

If you need custom slugs or analytics, those features are available through paid plans.

---

### Roadmap Highlights

To extend S.EE beyond traditional URL shortening, we are developing three new components:

* Link in Bio
* Text Paste
* File Sharing with direct links

They are currently in internal testing. All Lifetime plan users will receive access once they go live, without any extra charges.

Questions and feedback are welcome.

Happy Black Friday everyone.
