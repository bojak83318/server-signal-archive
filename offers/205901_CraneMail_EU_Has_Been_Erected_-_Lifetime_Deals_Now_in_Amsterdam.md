**NEW** FTPS Support + rClone
=============================

We've been working hard on improving the cloud storage functionality to give you even more ways to utilize our large storage offers.

We've still got our custom rClone builds and are working to get our storage API added to the mainline rClone releases. We recently completed a full overhaul of our backend storage API to improve rClone performance. You can find our [rClone builds on Github here](https://github.com/namecrane/rclone/releases).

We've also built a custom FTPS connector so you can **interact with your CraneMail storage from any app/service that supports FTPS**. We're still testing this out and making improvements, but it's available today on port 8221.

SFTP support is coming, we're still working on it. The best place to learn more and discuss/get help with the beta features is on our Discord - you can join us here: <https://discord.gg/tRbJjyVvmj>

**NEW** EU Location
===================

We've said goodbye to Luxembourg and Hallo to Amsterdam, our new EU location for all web and email hosting services. Web hosting plans were already live migrated over the past 2 weeks.

This move brings a bunch of improvements to our services, but the biggest is definitely connectivity. We're utilizing Eranium as our upstream with a higher quality bandwidth blend, plus a 100G peering port on ERA-IX to further improve our connectivity within the EU.
