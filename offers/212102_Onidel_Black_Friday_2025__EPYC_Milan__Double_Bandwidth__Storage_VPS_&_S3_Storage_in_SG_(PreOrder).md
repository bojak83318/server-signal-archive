**Bandwidth pooling applies to storage VM as well, so you can take advantage of excess bandwidth from other VMs!!!**

Looking for more capacity? We offer up to 10TB of storage by default - check out [our control panel](https://cloud.onidel.com/cloud/compute/vm/deploy).

10 TB is still not enough? Or you already have a NVMe VM with us and prefer to add extra storage capacity instead of having another VM? No problem, we've got you covered with HDD Block Storage!
