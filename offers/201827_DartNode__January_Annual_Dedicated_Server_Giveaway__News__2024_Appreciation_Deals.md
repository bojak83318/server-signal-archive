**DartNode January 2025 Update**

Happy New Year, LowEndTalk community! We had a super busy 2024 and that was in big part thanks to all of y'all. We are excited to share a small video highlighting an overview of where we've started and where we are! We've been hard at work expanding not only our environment, but also bringing more features to our control panel such as our newly deployed IP Manager.

We are working on bringing a custom instant deploy system for dedicated servers to enable those who need faster turnaround. Kansas City VPS servers are in their final stages of testing and will allow us to offer our current line of VPS offerings, as well as high availability clusters in the future.

2025 will bring exciting things our way. Expansion to our virtual offerings are in the works - we will be expanding into additional hardware lines such as Ryzen, and storage products. We are working on a tool that will allow you to snapshot VM's on any network and store your backup offsite on our network. These will dually be easily deployable onto the DartNode network in case you ever face outage elsewhere.

More details on all to come as we get closer.
