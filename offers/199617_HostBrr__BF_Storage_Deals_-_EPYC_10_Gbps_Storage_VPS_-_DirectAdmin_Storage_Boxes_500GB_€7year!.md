Hello LET!

HostBrr is back with a new offering just in time for Halloween, wait no, Singles day.. Eh, I mean Thanksgiving, or no is it Black Friday - Perhaps black month?! No matter what we are celebrating, we can all celebrate a good deal!

Take a look at our new storage node located in Frankfurt, powered by AMD EPYC 9334, DDR5 ECC, 2x10 Gbps uplinks, NVMe boot storage and that sweet large HDD RAID-6 Block storage! The no compromise storage VPS.

However, that is not the only new thing! HostBrr is now also offering DirectAdmin storage boxes, for those of you who do not need a VPS and just need a lot of storage for cheap! These storage boxes are hosted on AMD EPYC 7502 CPUs, DDR4 ECC RAM and fast NVMe cached HDD! These are perfect for backup storage, hosting your websites with large storage needs and so on without worrying about managing a VPS.

That is not all. We are also "innovative" and are offering reseller storage boxes! Seperate your storage requirements amongst several DirectAdmin users or use this service to bolster your arsenal of offerings to your clients by being able to offer them storage space for cheap!

Offers available as long as stock lasts or until December the 1st.

(Keep an eye out in this thread as we might have some limited stock offers coming up)
