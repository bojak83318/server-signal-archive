**Who are we ?**

We are here to offer a change of pace with our attractive offers and quality services. Bullethost is a Bulgarian based company and its in the business since 2018 starting with a couple of rented dedicated servers but quickly, within a year, we sourced our own hardware! Throughout the years we have gathered valuable experience in the field, guaranteeing top notch customer support, variety of plans tailored for your exclusive needs.

Currently, most of our hardware is located in the Netherlands (Skylink DC B.V - Eygelshoven) We utilize Aurologic firewall with up to 2000Gbps layer 3/4 DDoS protection on all web hosting, dedicated and VPS services. With our recent addition - a mix of brand new Dell R630 and HP Proliant G9 servers, each equipped with dual Intel Xeon 2695 v3 CPUs and 512GB of DDR4 RAM, along with our new ASN and fresh /24 IP block, we are excited to offer new opportunities for both existing and new customers.
