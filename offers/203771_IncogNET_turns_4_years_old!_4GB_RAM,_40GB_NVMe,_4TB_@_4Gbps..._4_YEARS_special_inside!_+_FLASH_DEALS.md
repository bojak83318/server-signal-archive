IncogNET turns 4 years old!
===========================

It's crazy how the time flies. IncogNET officially turns 4 years old in April, although technically we began in November of 2020, previously as INCOG.HOST.

IncogNET is truly a "bootstrapped" and self-funded passion project that has grown into something great. In 2020, I was working fulltime in a machine shop, machining and processing diecast aluminum parts for the auto-industry. Politically, a lot was happening towards the end of 2020 but one thing I was observing was more calls and support for online censorship on major platforms. Why was big tech so awful? Why is speech, that would be legal to say and shout from the sidewalk in an American city getting banned on what is now the modern day town hall and soapbox? I've been in the industry in one way or another since (*checks my WebHostingTalk registration date*: [01-02-2002](https://images2.imgbox.com/dc/d3/9vlNluSW_o.png "01-02-2002") )... both as a consumer of services and having previously owned a small hosting company and having worked in various roles for many others, both big and small. I wanted to jump back into the hosting industry, focusing on two things: End user privacy and supporting free speech.

I didn't have much to start with. INCOG.HOST was literally began on a 8GB BuyVM VPS with DirectAdmin and a DDoS protected IP. We did shared hosting only at the time, with the twist that you could opt-in to have your website mirrored to both Tor, I2P and Yggdrasil networks as a form of supporting alternative networks and as a means of bypassing censorship. All earnings, though quite small during this period, were invested back into the business to support it's growth.

Sometimes I look at [our old website](https://web.archive.org/web/20210120012445/https://incog.host/ "our old website") and think it looks better than our current one. It's nice to look back and see what I was attempting to achieve and offer then, and compare to where things are now. It's motivation to continue, no matter how slow the progress may sometimes seem.

Anyway, over the last 4 years I've seen my vision slowly but surely come into fruition. It's been challenging and it's been frustrating at times, it's been trying but ultimately I believe we're on the right track. IncogNET is by all standards of measurement still a small business with a slow and sustainable growth, achieved with no outside influence or funding. I'm proud of that. This isn't an easy industry to succeed in, yet here we are, year number 4, and the future looks bright. Slow and steady wins the race, I think.

Anyway, I'm proud that IncogNET is officially turning 4 years old and am happy to share some deals and promotions with LowEndTalk.

What is Internet Speech & Privacy LLC?
======================================

As many of you already know, IncogNET has several other non-hosting related projects such as a VPN service, email (on hold at the moment), and a DNS service in the works. These all deserve to have their own site, own branding and be available for purchase outside of IncogNET as well. (But will always still be available via IncogNET). Additionally, I have plans for another brand unrelated to IncogNET that will essentially act as a more "business oriented" rebrand of IncogNET, offering the same services that IncogNET does but under a new name. [Internet Speech & Privacy LLC](https://isp.llc) is simply acting as the parent to IncogNET LLC, and will be the parent to future brands as well. These brands will share the same network resources and infrastructure, so I believe this will make management of all of this a bit easier in the long term. Plus, I just really like the name and using the acronym, "ISP". ![;)](https://lowendtalk.com/resources/emoji/wink.png ";)")

This account ([@ISP)](https://lowendtalk.com/profile/ISP%29) will be used for posting sales threads on LowEndTalk, though you can still tag me ([@MannDude)](https://lowendtalk.com/profile/MannDude%29) if you need something related to IncogNET. My Patron Provider tag was expiring this month for my MannDude account so I renewed it for [@ISP](https://lowendtalk.com/profile/ISP) instead. Many other providers here operate in this fashion, and the mod and admin team are fine with it, so no worries there. You may see some ISP branding in the future, namely for things like DNS (Ex: ns.isp.st, ns.isp.vg, ns.isp.gd, etc, etc) but functionally, nothing has really changed. Internet Speech & Privacy is still ran by me (MannDude). This wasn't a sale, merger, or anything like that. It's simply just some business restructuring for the purpose of accommodating some longer term, bigger picture plans.

New plans and pricing for IncogNET Virtual Servers
==================================================

It's true! We're introducing new plans and a new pricing structure for IncogNET Virtual Servers for 2025.

**EXISTING CUSTOMERS NEED NOT WORRY:** Your plans and pricing remains the same. This includes those on our stock website plans and those who purchased previous promotional plans. More details on that later, though. I just wanted to touch base on this before I share our new plans/pricing.

Click to see our new stock website plans and pricing

| [vCPU] | [RAM] | [NVMe Storage] | [Bandwidth] | [Port] | [Monthly Price] |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 vCPU | 512MB | 15GB | 5TB/mo | 1.5Gbps | N/A ($14.25/qtr) |
| 1 vCPU | 1GB | 20GB | 6TB/mo | 1.5Gbps | $8.00 |
| 1 vCPU | 2GB | 30GB | 8TB/mo | 1.5Gbps | $12.00 |
| 2 vCPU | 4GB | 50GB | 10TB/mo | 2.5Gbps | $20.00 |
| 2 vCPU | 6GB | 70GB | 12TB/mo | 2.5Gbps | $28.00 |
| 2 vCPU | 8GB | 90GB | 15TB/mo | 2.5Gbps | $36.00 |
| 4 vCPU | 10GB | 120GB | 20TB/mo | 2.5Gbps | $50.00 |
| 4 vCPU | 12GB | 140GB | 25TB/mo | 2.5Gbps | $60.00 |
| 4 vCPU | 16GB | 160GB | 30TB/mo | 2.5Gbps | $70.00 |
| 6 vCPU | 20GB | 200GB | 40TB/mo | 5Gbps | $90.00 |
| 6 vCPU | 24GB | 250GB | 50TB/mo | 5Gbps | $110.00 |
| 6 vCPU | 32GB | 300GB | 60TB/mo | 5Gbps | $130.00 |
| 8 vCPU | 40GB | 400GB | 80TB/mo | 5Gbps | $160.00 |
| 10 vCPU | 48GB | 600GB | 100TB/mo | 5Gbps | $190.00 |
| 12 vCPU | 64GB | 800GB | 120TB/mo | 5Gbps | $220.00 |
| 14 vCPU | 80GB | 1TB | 140TB/mo | 5Gbps | $260.00 |
| 16 vCPU | 96GB | 1.2TB | 160TB/mo | 5Gbps | $300.00 |

Over the last four years, our plans and pricing structure has remained consistent. Our hardware deployments for VPS nodes has been pretty consistent too, which has led to observations on how the available hardware resources we deploy could be better used. Our new plans represent this, offering resources and pricing that is more comparable to providers like Digital Ocean, Vultr, Linode, etc. Even though LowEndTalk is not our main target market, we will, of course, still post special promotions here from time to time as well. ![:)](https://lowendtalk.com/resources/emoji/smile.png ":)")

**FOR EXISTING CUSTOMERS:** As mentioned above, your plans and pricing is **not** changing. You continue to receive what you paid for. You are not being migrated to new plans. You are not having your pricing adjusted. You will remain on our older deployment system using Virtualizor, while these new plans are using newer nodes and hardware and being deployed with VirtFusion. Should you wish to move to one of the new plans, you'll need to *self-migrate* by ordering a new VPS and cancelling your old VPS. I'll be happy to provide a discount to those who wish to do this for themselves, but we are not going to migrate individual user's virtual servers to new nodes and have our older plans mixed in with our new plans.
