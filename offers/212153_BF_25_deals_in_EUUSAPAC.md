# BF 25 deals in EU/US/APAC
**Link:** [Original Thread](https://lowendtalk.com/discussion/212153/bf-25-deals-in-eu-us-apac)

We've spent the past year upgrading our networks across all of our POPs, as well as working on our new control panel that is currently in closed beta. Join our [discord](https://discord.gg/tnPwYNdcCc "discord") here to get access.

We're also introducing our new HFC (high frequency compute) plans here. They are not available in all locations yet, but will be in the coming weeks and months.

As always, these are some no-frills deals from us. No need to post a comment or go through any other hoops to get double anything. But please do read what you are buying as these are non refundable / exchangeable.

**To order, please go to <https://cloud.hosthatch.com/sale/current-promotions>**

All sales are final. We cannot change with another service. We do not provide refunds (or credits) for these plans. Please make sure you are absolutely sure before placing an order.

**What is the setup time?**

The setup time is 10 working days (2 weeks). Most will get delivered much earlier. Some may get slightly delayed. Please order one of the packages from hosthatch.com directly if immediate provisioning is needed. We cannot offer faster provisioning on special plans.

**Are smaller plans available?**

Unfortunately no. Over the past few years, we have adjusted our offerings, to the point where we can maintain very high quality, performance and uptime at a fair price point.  
We no longer aim for the ultra low spec/price deadpool deals.

**Is BGP available?**

Yes, we offer BGP with a $10 USD setup fee per location, and no monthly recurring fee.

**Is IPv6 available?**

Routed /64 per VM is available in all locations and can be enabled from the control panel.

**Are there any other differences between our normal and discounted plans?**

Yes, primarily our support. It can take several days to resolve issues, especially issues that require complex investigation. Please choose one of the services from hosthatch.com directly for production usage, with access to our normal support queue. Our promotional services are provided at near-cost pricing to fill up excess capacity and should be used accordingly. We also do not offer location migrations and/or other flexibilities on these  
plans.

There is no difference in the quality of the servers itself - as we use the same backend, enterprise hardware and excellent monitoring for all of our services. We run a standardized and redundant Juniper based network in all of our locations, which allows us to deliver excellent uptime and network performance.

**What networks and datacenters do you use?**

Please view <https://www.hosthatch.com/features/> for Datacenters, looking glasses and test files

One of the things that differentiates us from most of the providers here is that we have redundancy at each step. We connect to at least two separate upstreams in each location, so we can be online even if one of our upstreams is completely offline. Ask your provider if they have this. ![:)](https://lowendtalk.com/resources/emoji/smile.png ":)")

**Why is X location/offer not available?**

We have more excess capacity in some locations as compared to others. Unfortunately, once it is sold out, it is sold out, and we cannot change this. There is a limited amount of capacity available in each location. We don't sell snake oil, we tell you upfront that this is a once a year special offer, that will not be available again any time soon.

**Can I change my server with the X offer?**

Unfortunately no. All sales are final, and we cannot offer any changes to them. We cannot replace one pending service with another. We also do not provide any refunds for pending orders. Please make sure you are 100% sure before placing an order, as there is very limited capacity available.

**These deals will be available until 29th November, 23:59 Eastern. Some of the deals/locations may go out of stock earlier, depending on capacity.**
