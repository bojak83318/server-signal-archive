**Link:** [Original Thread](https://lowendtalk.com/discussion/208284/knoxville-tn-data-center-seeking-local-tech-company-for-on-site-partnership)

We own and operate a fully equipped Tier 2+ data facility in Knoxville, TN and are seeking a technically capable local MSP, IT company, or infrastructure provider to form a long-term partnership and establish a physical presence on-site.

This is an ideal opportunity for a team that wants reliable colocation space, dedicated office access, and full hands-on control of their infrastructure. Our setup supports mutual benefit — combining robust infrastructure, physical access, and shared responsibility.

🏢 Facility Highlights:  
Up to 8 full cabinets in a secure, caged section of the facility

1–2 private office spaces available on-site (~200 sq ft each)

Dedicated 800 AMP electrical panel (3-phase), with:

Fire suppression via Fike Ecaro 25 clean agent system (maintained & tested)

27 tons of cooling with Mitsubishi split system (3 compressors, 9 wall units)

Anti-static Toro El Johnsonite flooring in data room and office area

🤝 What We’re Looking For:  
We’re interested in partnering with a company that:

Is based in or willing to establish operations in Knoxville, TN

Has experience in infrastructure management, hosting, or technical services

Desires hands-on control of their systems

Can operate independently (no dependency on our engineering team)

Will contribute fairly toward facility costs under a long-term lease or partnership

👋 About Us:  
We’ve operated this Knoxville data facility since 2014 and work with partner data centers in Georgia and the Chattanooga region to maintain a broader regional footprint. We’re now looking to collaborate with a capable local operator — someone who values uptime, autonomy, and professionalism.

MSPs planning for disaster recovery / business continuity

IT firms seeking secure, hands-on colocation space
