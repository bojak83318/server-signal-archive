# UK AMD Ryzen 9950x VPS | DDR5 | 10Gbps Network | Daily Backups | Windows & Linux + BlackFriday!!!!
**Link:** [Original Thread](https://lowendtalk.com/discussion/212236/uk-amd-ryzen-9950x-vps-ddr5-10gbps-network-daily-backups-windows-linux-blackfriday)

I am excited to introduce our brand-new UK VPS lineup powered by the AMD Ryzen 9950X (Zen 5), a major upgrade from our previous Ryzen 7900 (Zen 4) nodes. Zen 5 brings a significant boost in IPC, stronger single-core performance, and improved efficiency thanks to its redesigned execution engine and upgraded AI/branch prediction capabilities. Paired with our move to DDR5 5600 MT/s, the new platform delivers noticeably faster performance for hosting, game servers, databases, automation workloads, and anything that benefits from high-frequency compute power.

All our usual features are still included—NVMe storage, high-capacity bandwidth on 10Gbps networking, DDoS protection, and reliable UK infrastructure backed by responsive support. Our Black Friday deals are also still available with limited stock.
