⚡ Our VPS Series – Amsterdam & Eygelshoven ⚡
--------------------------------------------

First of all, **thank you** ❤️  
The year that has just ended was important for us: we learned a lot, faced challenges, and continued to grow step by step thanks to your support.

As we move into **2026**, we have many plans and ideas in progress.  
We know there is still a lot of work to do on our network and infrastructure, but we are actively working on it every day. Over the past months, we have focused heavily on optimization and improvements, and we believe we are moving in the right direction, with clear goals and continuous effort.

Our mission remains the same:  
👉 **provide simple, affordable, and continuously improving VPS solutions**, accessible to everyone.

---

🌍 VPS Solutions for Lightweight Projects
----------------------------------------

Our VPS lines are designed for users who need **low-cost, practical solutions** for everyday usage.  
They are ideal for:

* small projects
* development environments
* learning and testing
* lightweight services
* labs and experiments

These VPS are **not meant for heavy or extreme workloads**, but for handling light tasks reliably while keeping prices as low as possible.

We are fully aware that perfection takes time and there is still room for improvement — but we are committed to working on it consistently.
