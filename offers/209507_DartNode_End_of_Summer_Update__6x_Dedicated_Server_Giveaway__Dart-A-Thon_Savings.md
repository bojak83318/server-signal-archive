DartNode News and [Dart-a-Thon 2025 Warehouse Specials](https://dartnode.com/dartathon "Dart-a-Thon 2025 Warehouse Specials")
=============================================================================================================================

Howdy, LowEndTalk!

It's been a while, and a lot of **excitement** has elapsed. I regret not being more active on here lately, but things have been very busy behind the scenes for [@keoir](https://lowendtalk.com/profile/keoir) and myself. We've always taken feedback from the community seriously, and this hasn't changed despite DartNode's growth. Implementation of automation into our 7-day Moneyback Guarantee, and empowering more of our staff with accounting tools should make a noticeable impact on related ticket response time. Recently we've seen the rollout of internal tools for our staff, as well as increased cross training to increase support efficiency across the board.

On the **infrastructure** side, we've employed new hardware strategies and internal policy to increase overall reliability and disaster response. We appreciate and encourage all feedback as ultimately that is our best metric for overall improvement.

**Exciting news**, we will be growing our VPS footprint! Those of you who keep up with us might remember Kansas City VPS' teased a long while ago. I am pleased to officially announce that KC will be live in time for Black Friday specials. There will also be another location launching on the East Coast! More details on those to come. These locations will offer our full VPS lineup.

We've noticed our **VDS plans** have been perpetually sold out since we launched them about a year ago. We are expanding the VDS lineup with a new order flow, which will allow you to select a more dynamic "slice" when ordering, rather than conforming to pre-determined plans. During the event we will post some more info on these!

**Dart-a-Thon** has officially arrived. For the next weeks, all the way until October 31, we’re rolling out some of the most aggressive dedicated server deals we’ve ever offered. We’re leaning on our remaining stock of Xeon v4 hardware to bring serious power at recurring prices that are hard to beat.

Like always, all specials are true **recurring**, no first-month gimmicks. Once you grab a deal, it’s yours at that price for as long as you keep the server.
