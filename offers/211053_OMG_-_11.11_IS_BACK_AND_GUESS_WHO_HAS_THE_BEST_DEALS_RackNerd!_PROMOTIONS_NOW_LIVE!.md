[![RackNerd 11.11 Deals](https://blog.racknerd.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/11-11-deals.png)](https://racknerd.com/11-11)

RackNerd’s **11.11 promotions** are live, and once again we’re bringing the community the type of deals that have made this event so highly anticipated. In addition to fresh deals, this time around, we’re proud to share two major updates: we recently expanded to Toronto, and following high demand, we’ve successfully restocked inventory in our popular **Los Angeles DC-02 location** *(Asia Optimized network)* - which is now available for 11.11 plans 2GB and up. Add that to our already strong lineup of current in-stock locations such as San Jose, Seattle, Chicago, Dallas, New York, Ashburn, and France -- and with the significant effort we’ve put into scaling and replenishing inventory across multiple datacenters, availability is stronger than ever for this year’s 11.11 event!

This year has been a milestone of growth for RackNerd. We have once again earned recognition on the Inc. 5000, ranking #3036 nationally in 2025, and also securing the #94 spot on the 2025 Regionals Pacific list. These achievements build upon our prior accomplishments of ranking #1506 nationally in 2024, #16 in the telecommunications sector, and #58 on the Regionals Pacific list. Our growth is directly tied to the community that has supported us, and we couldn’t be more grateful. You can view our official Inc. profile here: <https://www.inc.com/profile/racknerd-llc>

Being consistently voted as a **LET Top Provider** year after year reminds us why we do this. The relationships and feedback we receive from this community continue to inspire us, and it’s what pushes us to keep expanding, innovating, and delivering even more value back to you.

Our specials scale up from 1GB all the way to 4GB VPS packages, with each tier offering powerful resources, enterprise SSD storage, full root access, and dedicated IPv4. And now with more datacenter choices, including Toronto and LA DC-02, you have even more flexibility to deploy where it makes the most sense for you.
