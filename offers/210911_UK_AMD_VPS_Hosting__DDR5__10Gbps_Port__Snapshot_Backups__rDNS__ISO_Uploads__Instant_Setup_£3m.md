Hi All,

We’ve recently given our UK VPS lineup at VM6 Networks a serious performance boost.  
All nodes have been upgraded to the latest AMD Ryzen 9 7900 processors, paired with DDR5 4800 MHz memory and Gen 4 NVMe storage, all running on a 10 Gbps network. Every VPS includes dedicated bandwidth — we don’t oversell resources.

Our infrastructure operates from a Coventry-based UK datacentre, featuring enterprise-grade DDoS protection and automated off-site backups.  
If you’re running production services, development environments, or testing workloads that demand reliability and speed, you’ll appreciate the upgrade.
