# DartNode: Black Friday Edition 2025 - Ryzen 9950X Dedicated Giveaway - Deals Inside - We Go to Space
**Link:** [Original Thread](https://lowendtalk.com/discussion/212180/dartnode-black-friday-edition-2025-ryzen-9950x-dedicated-giveaway-deals-inside-we-go-to-space)

DartNode: Black Friday Edition 2025
===================================

![](https://dartnode.com/_branding/black_color_full.png)

Howdy and welcome, LowEndTalk! We are back and boy have we been busy as heck! We have 3 new locations, a revamped (and more responsive) VM dashboard, completely overhauled our VDS offerings (now called slices), improved our back end dedicated management network, added more support staff, and a rework of our back end VM management.

Our locations going forward are utilizing the following naming scheme:

* US South (Houston)
* US East (Orlando)
* US Central (Kansas City)
* US West (Los Angeles)

These are the regions and specific metros we currently operate in. We may eventually add more metros to each region.

VPS' are ready to deploy in all but US West locations. US West will be deploying VM's by the end of December. Dedicated servers are US South for a little while longer until we get the last few pieces figured out.

State of the Market
===================

It's no secret RAM prices have skyrocketed and drives are climbing steadily as well. We did our best to keep things reasonable, as the Wholesale Cloud we always try to pass along as much as we can to the consumers. When shopping this year please keep in mind most providers have been impacted and we are doing what we can to shield y'all from the brunt of it.

Space Specials
==============

We have been and are currently working on a customer project that is launching on SpaceX Transporter 15! Some of you may know that our roots are in Space Software and Engineering, and this will push us over 20 supported missions that saw space flight! Our previous missions were mostly ISS and lunar oriented, this one is supporting LEO satellites. In honor of this mission, we will be launching specials after launch. Launch is currently planned for Friday but you can keep up with it here: <https://www.spacex.com/launches/transporter-15>

VDS Are Now Slices
==================

<https://dartnode.com/slices>

We've redone this, ever since we started offering dedicated resource VM's, they've been out of stock perpetually. Our new slice system lets you view all nodes, availability, region, and even combine slices to get the size of machine you need.

We're deploying over a dozen slice nodes over the next few days so keep an eye out. These will include Ryzen, Intel, and EPYC.
