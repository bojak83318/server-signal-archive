# MXroute - Limited $5/year promo
**Link:** [Original Thread](https://lowendtalk.com/discussion/214832/mxroute-limited-5-year-promo)

Hey friends!

In true LET fashion I'm leaning on good old fashioned forum drama to bring back a very limited offer that has been the most requested of me for years. First, let me introduce you to the drama, then the offer. Here's the good stuff, in a nice block to make it easy to skip over:

> I said I once terminated someone for a bad review, but clarified that the review was the last straw after they endlessly and unjustifiably kept berating us in tickets. The real fault was taking that long to terminate him IMO. That said, it was the determination of two users that if the review were even a partial consideration, even 0.1% of it, I have committed crimes against humanity. Now, for my sin, I will be followed into every thread where attempts to cost me business will be made until I submit to one of the user’s values and also explain every bad review I’ve had in over a decade of business. Of course, ignoring that my first answer to each one is already not to be believed, I'm supposed to believe a second explanation would be... nah, these guys just want to see me dance for their approval. Watch, they'll be here to keep berating me any minute. They'll cite every bad review on TrustPilot that you've already read, because the people who abused our service are obviously the most trustworthy around. Well, here's my dance.

We've come a long way already this year with a brand new frontend for billing and for managing your email. We've thrown in the long requested Cal/CardDAV. Disk quotas finally almost all display correctly... wild I know. We have an API for sending email and an API for managing everything in our mail control panel. We have a fresh WHMCS module for resellers and a brand new set of branding options in that panel for our resellers (custom URL, color schemes, server names, DNS records, the works). MXroute is finally growing up!

Now I'd like to share with you a special, limited offer:

Package name: WyvernCo\_and\_forest\_are\_psycho  
Limits:

* 10GB storage
* Unlimited email accounts/domains
* 400 outbound emails per hour (per email address, if pushing the limits each email account needs to be for it's own purpose, no "I can hit 800 per hour by just making 2 accounts to send my newsletter")
* Price: $5/year
* Order link: <https://management.mxroute.com/order/350>

I know I said never again, but I just couldn't pass up the chance ![:heart:](https://lowendtalk.com/resources/emoji/heart.png ":heart:")
