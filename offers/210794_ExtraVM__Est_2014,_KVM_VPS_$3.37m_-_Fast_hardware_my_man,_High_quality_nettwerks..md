Most locations have great DDoS protection. In our Dallas, Los Angeles US locations we have GSL upstream. In Singapore, we directly use Datapacket and offer their unmetered protection. In Tokyo we have GSL upstream but will be adding Datapacket as well. In New Jersey and Amsterdam we use RoyaleHosting network.
