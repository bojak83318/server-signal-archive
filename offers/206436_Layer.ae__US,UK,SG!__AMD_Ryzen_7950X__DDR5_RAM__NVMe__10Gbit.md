**About Us**

We've had offers going all the way back to 2012 under our previous brand. We have rebranded into Layer (a registered company in Dubai, with trade license number 900809, and real offices) 5 years ago, and have been working really hard in Dubai with local businesses - where we are offering all in one service contracts for social media management, infrastructure management, web design services, hosting, and more. With a major focus on B2B.

We currently host our customers out of Dubai, Germany, New York, Spokane, WA, Coventry, UK and Singapore. With expansions planned very soon.

These expansions will help us improve our service offerings, and provide additional services to the wider public, by shifting from our traditional B2B approach to B2B as well as B2C. Services for all!

And yes, we still do have many happy clients with active services from even before Layer!

Operating as Layer for 5 years now with many happy clients  
Premium Hardware & Support

**F.A.Q**

Q. What is allowed? What isn't?  
A. TLDR; All legal services are welcome at Layer. We do NOT allow adult content, spam, phishing, hacking, DDoS, public proxies, mining, port scanning, TOR, and public tracker torrents on our network.

Q. What kind of support is provided?   
A. Our products and services are completely unmanaged. Support will be limited to network and access related queries.

Q. Do you limit any ports? Is mailing allowed?  
A. By default port 25 is blocked. We can open firewall rules to well known relays.

Q. Is Nested Virt / AMD-V enabled?  
A. No.

Q. My order was rejected! Help!  
A. The only time we will reject your order is when/if you used fake information or a VPN. Make sure all the details are correct, and you are using an IP matching your signup details. If you are still facing issues, please contact us.

Q. Are the resources dedicated to me?  
A. No, they are provided to you on a fair share concept.

Q. Can you help me upload an ISO?  
A. Certainly! Please open a ticket and provide us with the details.

Q. Can I set my own rDNS?  
A. Yes, rDNS can be set automatically in our VirtFusion control panel.

Q. Can you announce my IPs?  
A. Certainly! Please open a ticket and provide us with the details.

Q. Your website lists services for social media management, creative content, photography, and web design. Are you a hosting provider or a creative agency?  
A. Long gone are the days where you focus on one service, especially when our customers are expecting us to manage their social media, create their websites, manage the servers and infrastructure, and so on. This is why, we, as Layer decided to provide all our services publicly on our website for both our B2B and our B2C customers.

Q. My question is not listed here .. what can I do?  
A. Please contact us.
