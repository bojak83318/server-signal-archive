# Gullo's Hosting | Guess who's back! | NAT, LittleVZ | New Locations and Bundles!
**Link:** [Original Thread](https://lowendtalk.com/discussion/177716/gullos-hosting-guess-whos-back-nat-littlevz-new-locations-and-bundles)

Hey Guys!

It's been a while, and a lot has changed! I have a new website and I've added some new locations! I now have France and Poland available on my NAT VPS and I have Australia on my LittleVZ's.

If you know me, you probably remember my dirt-cheap NAT VPS servers, which are pretty great. But do you know what's even better? I do! A dirt-cheap dedicated IPv4 VPS! I call them, LittleVZ's. Well, What are you waiting for! Take a look at the offer! I also threw in my classic NAT Deal's ![:)](https://lowendtalk.com/resources/emoji/smile.png ":)")

As always, if you have any questions please ask! I am here to help.

I am offering these servers myself and not as a company. If you have any questions or need support at any time it will always be me answering you, Because of this the whole support process will be more streamlined as you will only be talking with me. It is my goal to keep all users satisfied by any means and I will strive to do so.

Looking for something else? I can accommodate a wide range of applications. Send me a support ticket so I can set you up with custom VPS offers!
