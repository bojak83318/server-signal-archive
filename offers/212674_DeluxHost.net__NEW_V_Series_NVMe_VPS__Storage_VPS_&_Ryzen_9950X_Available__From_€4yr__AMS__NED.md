⚡ Amsterdam VPS – V Series ⚡
============================

After the success of our previous solutions, we are proud to introduce the brand new **V Series**, a VPS line designed for those who are looking for **lightweight performance, solid stability, and affordable pricing**, without compromising on network quality.

✅ Perfect for:

* small projects
* development environments
* network labs
* learning, testing, and experimentation

Over the past months, we have continued to **strengthen our infrastructure in Amsterdam**, improving:  
⚡ overall stability  
⚡ latency  
⚡ global reliability

🔒 **During the last few weeks, we have also resolved several critical issues**, and based on our internal monitoring and tests, the network is now proving to be **stable and resilient against attacks**.  
We are continuously **investing in our infrastructure** to provide a safer and more reliable service every day.

📉 **RAM Market Situation**  
As many already know, the hardware market is currently facing a difficult period, with **strong pressure on RAM costs worldwide**.  
Despite this, we are doing everything possible to **keep our prices as low and competitive as we can**, because our project was born with one clear mission:

👉 **make servers accessible to everyone**, especially for students, learners, developers, and anyone working on lightweight projects.

We cannot guarantee how long these prices will remain unchanged, but **as long as it is possible, we will keep them this way**.
