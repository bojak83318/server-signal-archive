# [New location] Bremen | AMD EPYC TURIN | DDR5 | NVMe
**Link:** [Original Thread](https://lowendtalk.com/discussion/212908/new-location-bremen-amd-epyc-turin-ddr5-nvme)

Hey LET 👋,

we’re back with another announcement! We now bring our AMD EPYC Turin lineup to Bremen, Germany. To be specific our completely new cluster is located in the LWLCOM data center and is mostly based on the following hardware: AMD EPYC 9655, Micron DDR5 6400 MHz, 100 Gbit/s network and Micron 9550 Pro PCIe 5.0 NVMes.

The datacenter itself has an ISO 27001 certificate, a UPS (N+1 redundancy), a diesel generator and is powered by green energy. You can get more information at <https://www.lwlcom.net/rechenzentren>

As most have already recognized the memory shortage led to a huge price increase in memory prices. Despite that, we decided to make some promos available (net pricing | see below for VAT info):
