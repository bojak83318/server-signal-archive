# DigitalFyre | Celebrating our website re-launch with the LET Community with VPS from $2.00/mo
**Link:** [Original Thread](https://lowendtalk.com/discussion/210107/digitalfyre-celebrating-our-website-re-launch-with-the-let-community-with-vps-from-2-00-mo)

Hi LET!

DigitalFyre here! Some of you may have seen our comments or offers in the Requests section over the years.

We've been offering hosting since 2009 and have been part of the LET community since 2016. With the recent relaunch of our website and customer portal, we thought it'd be a great time to celebrate with the LET community by offering an exclusive discount and upgrade on some of our plans that may appeal to those seeking solid infrastructure at competitive prices.

While we don't consider ourselves a traditional "low-end provider", we do try to make our pricing affordable and fair - backed by reliable hardware, strong network presence, and responsive support.
