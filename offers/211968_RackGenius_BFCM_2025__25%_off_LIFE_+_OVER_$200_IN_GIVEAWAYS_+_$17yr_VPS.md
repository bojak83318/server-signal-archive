Hey LET 👋

Some of you might remember us as **Snakecraft Hosting**. We rebranded to **RackGenius** earlier this year – same people, same racks in 123Net DC4 (Grand Rapids, MI), just a less snake-y name and a lot more fiber.

This year we’re rolling **Black Friday + Cyber Monday** into one thread with **LET-exclusive coupons** and a small giveaway. Even better deals to come in the megathread later this week, stay tuned!

---

**Quarterly billing**
