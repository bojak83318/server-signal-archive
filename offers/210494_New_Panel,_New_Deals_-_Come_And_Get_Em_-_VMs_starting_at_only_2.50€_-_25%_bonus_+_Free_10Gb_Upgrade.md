🌐 AVS ISP – New Panel Launch Promo (14 Days Only)
-------------------------------------------------

Hey everyone,

As a lot of you’ve already seen, we just rolled out our brand new customer panel and website built from the ground up for speed, automation, and simplicity. We've finally ditched off the WHMCS bandwagon. To celebrate, we’re running a limited-time launch promo for the next 14 days.

* **+25% Bonus Credit:**  
  Add credit to your account (minimum €5) and post your invoice number in this thread.  
  We’ll add 25% extra credit to your balance - use it anytime, it never expires.  
  *(No limit - top up as much as you want.) For example add 10€, we'll add 2.50€ - add 100€, we'll add 25€.*
* **Free 10Gbps Port Upgrade:**  
  Order any VPS, post your Server ID here, and we’ll upgrade your port from 1Gbps -> 10Gbps at no charge.

🕒 Both offers apply only to purchases made during the promo period (valid for 14 days from today).

How? Signup at <https://www.avsisp.com> and add credit, order a VM, and post the invoice number and VM number here!

### 👉 Locations & Plans

* Right now, we are only offering London, UK with Ireland Geo IPs. However, more locations are already planned. In the panel, you will see them greyed out with "coming soon". Don't worry - they'll be available before you know it.
* Prices start at only €2.50 for our smallest package (1 CPU, 1GB RAM, 20GB NVME Space) with multiple other packages available. Feel free to check them out on our website.

### 🧠 A Few Notes About the New Panel

* **Privacy-Friendly Signup:** Only a name (of your choice) and a valid email required.
* **Fully Automated VM Setup:** VMs are deployed automatically every 5 minutes — no manual wait times anymore.
* **Port 25:** Blocked by default. You can request an unblock via ticket with proper justification (small fee applies).
* **rDNS Support:** Available via ticket for now - will be self-service soon in the panel.
* **Flexible Terms:** All services are billed monthly; after setup, you can extend for 1, 3, 6, or 12 months (and stack them if you like).
* **Prepaid Credit System:** We’ve switched to a cloud-style prepaid model - fewer payment fees for us means better pricing for you.
* **Referral Program:** Coming soon! It’s built into the new panel and will be live shortly - all existing users will get an email when it’s ready.
* **BGP Sessions:** BGP Sessions are possible. Just send a ticket. We are working on making the entire BGP process automated in the future. Note - there is a €5 fee per month for BGP sessions.

### 💳 Payments

Currently, PayPal (instant crediting) is supported - just make sure you pay with card or PayPal balance. If you use bank transfer through PayPal, credit will appear only once the transfer clears (a few days delay).

We can also accept other methods by ticket. We’re going through the PCI-DSS process, and awaiting Stripe’s final approval for card-based top-ups in the new panel. Other methods are being added soon.

Thanks to everyone for your continued support - the feedback from the community has been invaluable while building this system. We hope you enjoy the new panel, and as always, feel free to share feedback here or via ticket.
