# Amsterdam is LIVE! AMD EPYC + NVMe KVM VPS up to 25% OFF with unmetered bandwidth
**Link:** [Original Thread](https://lowendtalk.com/discussion/210738/amsterdam-is-live-amd-epyc-nvme-kvm-vps-up-to-25-off-with-unmetered-bandwidth)

Hi LET 💜,

Our Amsterdam zone is live, powered by AMD EPYC CPUs!

![](https://i.imgur.com/pBjyAm8.png)

This region connects directly into AMS-IX and hundreds of carriers, giving you some of the lowest latency in Western Europe.

If you're new to us, allow me to introduce **LumaDock** - a simple VPS platform, designed for developers and small teams by **LifeinCloud** (without all the managed B2B & private cloud features that our main brand has). We’ve been building and managing our own infrastructure since 2009 with no reselling or outsourcing. We own our hardware and operate our own datacenter in Bucharest, with additional Tier III zones in London, Frankfurt, Paris - and now Amsterdam. YAY!

* we own the hardware, not resellers
* our 24/7 support is in-house
* deployment is almost instant (seconds, not hours)
* no overprovisioning
* no setup fees
* no surprises
* 30-day money-back guarantee if you don't 💜 the VPS
