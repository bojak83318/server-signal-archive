# SMARTNET Silicon Valley Colocation Pre-Sale Deal
**Link:** [Original Thread](https://lowendtalk.com/discussion/212525/smartnet-silicon-valley-colocation-pre-sale-deal)

After we had to discontinue our HongKong project due to too many issues with T1 and T2 carriers, we would like to announce that we have a new PoP at Equinix SV4.

1 or 2U Colocation (300W power included)  
1Gbps port unmetered flat  
Free BGP sessions  
IPMI OOB Uplink included  
Anti DDoS included  
Special Deal price: 140 EUR/ per month   
150 EUR setup fee

All orders placed before December 31st get 2x10G ports instead of 2x1G.

Go live of this PoP should be mid December, we are just waiting for connectivity.

This offer could also be interesting for people that need low latency to Japan or China.

If you are interested just send us a message here on LET or via <https://as203446.net/colocation>
