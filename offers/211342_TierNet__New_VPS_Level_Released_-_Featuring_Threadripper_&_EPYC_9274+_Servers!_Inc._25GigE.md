We’re excited to announce a brand-new level of VPS servers now available on our platform!

This new tier includes top-of-the-line hardware, featuring:

* **AMD Ryzen Threadripper 7965WX – delivering extreme single core performance for heavy workloads.**
* **EPYC 9274 (and higher) – offering unmatched reliability, speed, and enterprise-grade stability.**

Have you ever wondered where the optimal choice is between a dedicated server and a VPS server? Right here – a **new dimension of VPS services with dedicated cores (up to 48).**

What else? Man lives by more than just processors. Port speed is also important – choose from **1Gbps, 10Gbps, and 25GigE** ports available!

And if that's not enough, we offer full server customization. **You choose the disk size, number of cores, RAM (up to 192GB) and port**. Looking for something custom? You've come to the right place.

You're probably thinking, "Ehh, that's going to be expensive". Not with us! Our basic setup starts at just **$8.50/month.**
