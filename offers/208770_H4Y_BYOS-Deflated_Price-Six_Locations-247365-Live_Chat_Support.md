**Who Benefits Most from a BYOS Build?**  
When workloads don’t fit a one-size-fits-all server, BYOS puts you in control of infrastructure that matches your performance needs, budget, and deployment plan. Teams that demand hardware control, transparent pricing, and growth-ready scalability rely on BYOS.  
Common BYOS Use Cases  
● Enterprise & Regulated Environments: \*\* Build compliance-ready servers with your choice of data center location, DDoS protection, and encryption options, without paying for unused capacity.  
● Development & DevOps Workflows: Deploy tailored test and production servers with precise CPU, RAM, and storage to streamline CI/CD pipelines and container orchestration.  
● SaaS Startups & Growing Platforms: Start lean with minimal investment, then scale compute, memory, or storage as your user base expands, with no migration required.
