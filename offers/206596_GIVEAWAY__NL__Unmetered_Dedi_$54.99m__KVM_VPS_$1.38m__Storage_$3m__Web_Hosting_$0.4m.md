### ⚠️ PLEASE READ THE FAQ BEFORE ASKING QUESTIONS OR PURCHASING

  
❓ Shared Hosting FAQ (click to expand)

**Q: Do you use LiteSpeed web server?**  
A: No, we currently use Apache on our shared hosting plans. However, performance is optimized using caching and resource limits are generous.

**Q: Is Node.js available on shared hosting?**  
A: No, Node.js is not supported on our shared hosting plans at this time.

**Q: Is SSH access available on shared hosting?**  
A: No, SSH access is not provided on shared hosting plans.

**Q: My emails are not reaching inbox and are going to spam. Why?**  
A: We provide shared hosting, not specialized email delivery services. For reliable inbox delivery, we recommend using an external SMTP relay like Mailgun, Mailjet, or Mailchimp.

**Q: Is Softaculous available?**  
A: Not right now, but we plan to add Softaculous very soon for easier script and CMS installs.

**Q: Is this service managed or unmanaged?**  
A: Our shared hosting service is **unmanaged**. If you have problems installing your scripts or code, please ensure the issue is 100% on your end before opening a support ticket. We’re happy to help where we can, but we are **not responsible** for debugging or fixing your custom code. Blaming our servers won’t help, so please check your scripts carefully.

**Q: Do you offer backups?**  
A: We do back up our servers regularly, but as with any system, unexpected failures can happen. That’s why we **strongly advise** all users to maintain their own backups. We take **no responsibility for data loss** — always back up your important files manually.

**Q: Is adult content or movie website hosting allowed?**  
A: Any **legal content** that doesn’t generate abuse reports is allowed. However, if we receive **any abuse complaints**, we will terminate the service immediately — our pricing is too low to justify time spent handling abuse cases.

**Q: Can I get a dedicated IP address?**  
A: Dedicated IPs are only available for **reseller hosting** plans. Shared plans do not support dedicated IPs at this time.

**Q: Is there a refund?**  
A: Usually, special offers are **not refundable**. We strongly recommend reading our FAQ before purchasing. If our team deems that a refund must be issued, they will do so. If not, they are **not obliged** to refund.

**Q: What does “unmetered bandwidth” mean?**  
A: Unmetered means you can transfer unlimited data, but if your usage negatively impacts our network or other customers, we may throttle your speeds or contact you. Activities like large-scale file sharing or abuse are prohibited. This ensures fair access and service quality for everyone.

**Q: Is spamming allowed?**  
A: Absolutely not. Spamming is strictly prohibited on our network for any reason whatsoever.

### ⚠️ PLEASE READ THE FAQ BEFORE ASKING QUESTIONS OR PURCHASING

  
❓ KVM VPS & STORAGE VPS FAQ (click to expand)

**Q: Is this service managed or unmanaged?**  
A: All our VPS plans are **unmanaged**. You're responsible for managing your OS, apps, and configurations. We’re happy to assist with general guidance, but we are **not obliged** to debug or fix your code or software issues.

**Q: Do you offer backups?**  
A: We do take internal backups on the host level, but you should **never rely solely on our backups**. Always set up your own external backup system. We are **not responsible** for any data loss.

**Q: Is adult content or movie website hosting allowed?**  
A: Any **legal content** that doesn’t generate abuse reports is allowed. However, if we receive **any abuse complaints**, we will terminate the service immediately — our pricing does not allow for time spent on abuse handling.

**Q: Is there a refund?**  
A: VPS special deals are generally **non-refundable**. Please read the FAQ before ordering. If our team determines a refund is appropriate, it will be issued — otherwise, refunds are **not guaranteed**.

**Q: What does “unmetered bandwidth” mean?**  
A: You can use as much bandwidth as you need, but if your usage negatively affects other users or the network, we may apply limits or contact you. Abusive use (e.g., heavy scraping, illegal content) is not allowed. This is to ensure fair usage for all clients.

**Q: Why am I not getting Full Port speed on my VPS?**  
A: The Full Port Speed on our KVM VPS plans is **shared** among multiple users on the same node. While we provide unmetered bandwidth, the port itself is not dedicated to your VPS. During **peak times**, you may experience slower speeds due to overall network usage. If you require consistent full-speed performance, consider reaching out for a **dedicated port** option.

**Q: My emails are not reaching inbox and are going to spam. Why?**  
A: We provide VPS hosting, not email delivery services. For proper inbox delivery, we recommend using a third-party SMTP relay like Mailgun, Mailjet, or Mailchimp.

**Q: My VPS IP is not clean or blacklisted — why?**  
A: We never guarantee that your IP will be 100% whitelisted. Our VPS subnets are heavily used, and occasionally some IPs may appear on blacklists. If clean IPs are critical to your setup, we recommend using external mail relay services.

**Q: Is Port 25 open by default?**  
A: No, Port 25 is **blocked by default** to prevent spam abuse. If you have a **valid reason** (e.g., running a legitimate mail server), you can open a support ticket to request it be unblocked. Requests are reviewed case-by-case.

### ⚠️ PLEASE READ THE FAQ BEFORE ASKING QUESTIONS OR PURCHASING

  
❓ Dedicated Server FAQ (click to expand)

**Q: Can I use the full bandwidth and port speed on my dedicated server?**  
A: Yes, absolutely. Since your server is connected via a dedicated port, you're allowed to fully utilize both the bandwidth and the port speed available to you. There are no restrictions on usage, it's yours to use as needed.

**Q: Do these include IPMI or remote access?**  
A: Yes, most dedicated servers come with IPMI or iKVM — open a ticket for credentials.

**Q: Are the servers delivered instantly?**  
A: Setup usually takes 4–24 hours if in stock. You’ll receive an email once it's ready.

**Q: Can I use a custom OS or ISO?**  
A: Yes! Let us know the ISO or image you'd like to use and we’ll mount it for you.

**Q: Is DMCA ignored on your dedicated servers?**  
A: We do not ignore any legal complaints. You are responsible for your server’s content. Any valid report we receive must be addressed. Failure to respond can lead to suspension or termination of service
