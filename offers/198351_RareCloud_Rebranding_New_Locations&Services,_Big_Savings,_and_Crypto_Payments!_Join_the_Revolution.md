**We hope you like our offers so far, but we’re not stopping here!**  
We’ve got even more in store to help you get the best value out of your VPS experience. Check out these amazing additional perks:

**Free Resources**  
We will increase your resources on your VPS (RAM, Storage, BW) for any member commenting with their Order # on this post. For every order, you can choose between the following:

* **512MB RAM**
* **15GB SSD Storage**
* **2TB Bandwidth**
* **1 IPv4** (Valid only for Monthly orders exceeding $10)

**Free VPS**  
**2+1 VPS**: Order any 2 VPS, and you'll get the third for free, matching the lowest ordered plan and billing period. Just comment with your Order #.

**Note**: These offers cannot be combined. You can only choose one free option from **Free Resources** or **Free VPS**. Additionally, the **Free IPv4** is only valid for monthly orders exceeding **$10**.

**Think our offers are done? Think again!**  
We have another incredible deal waiting for you:

**Double Resources**  
The first **five customers** that comment with their Order # will have their **resources doubled** (CPU, RAM, Storage, and Bandwidth). Don’t miss out on this limited-time offer!

---

**Payment Methods**  
We offer multiple payment options to make your purchases convenient and secure:

* **PayPal basic** (one-time payments + subscribe options)
* **Credit Card (Stripe)**
* **Credit Card (Alipay)**
* **Cryptocurrency**

We know many members asked us to add **Cryptocurrency** as a payment method, and we're excited to announce that this option is now available!

---

*As part of our rebranding and partnership with top-tier collaborators, we’ve made the decision to streamline our payments by moving from USD to EUR. Being a European Union-based company, it only makes sense for our base currency to be in euros, aligning with our commitment to provide a more localized service experience. However, we also understand the need for flexibility, so clients can still choose to be billed in USD if preferred. This change ensures we continue to offer the best quality and value across all our services.*

**14-Day Refund Policy**  
You can buy or order with confidence. If you're not satisfied with the quality-price ratio, we'll refund your money within **14 days**.

---

**Our Technology**  
At **RareCloud**, we’ve increased our resources and partnered with industry-leading collaborators to provide faster, more secure, and reliable services. Our infrastructure is built on **AMD Ryzen 7 3700x CPUs** in Germany, **Dual Intel E5-2690v4 CPUs** in other locations, and **NVMe SSD storage** across the board for ultra-fast performance.
