* These are **wholesale reseller accounts** — perfect for hosting providers looking to offer DirectAdmin to their clients.
* Plans are hosted on our London node. This service (DirectAdmin) has 4TB of NVME dedicated to it with 10Gb/s connection dedicated. This ensures we do not oversell and you get the best service available.
* If a package is showing OOS, choose another package. We will not replenish stock on these as we do not oversell drive space. This is hosted on a dedicated 4TB NVME drive fully dedicated to this. Packages are split to optimize availability; orders are first-come, first-serve.
* Dedicated support via WhatsApp available for no cost. Simply ask for the number in a ticket. This is for your account and server issues. We do not provide support to your end users.

* Prices are in LEK. A simple way to estimate in Euros is to drop the last two zeros (e.g., 2,000 L ≈ €20). Exchange rates fluctuate, so this is only an estimate. You can always check “X LEK to USD” or “X LEK to EUR” online. At the time of posting, 83 L ≈ 1 USD and 97 L ≈ 1 EUR. Actual conversion will be handled by PayPal or card processor at the time of payment. The EUR/USD amounts listed above are approximate.
