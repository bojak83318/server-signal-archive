# Full KVM Hardware Virtualization at $3.00/month | Double RAM AND Double Bandwidth | Upgrade Options
**Link:** [Original Thread](https://lowendtalk.com/discussion/210612/full-kvm-hardware-virtualization-at-3-00-month-double-ram-and-double-bandwidth-upgrade-options)

All signups get double RAM and double bandwidth, double what is listed here. Please post your invoice number here and I will manually adjust the RAM and bandwidth as soon as possible. I will check here once or twice per day for any invoice postings. Keep in mind when I double the RAM I will have to reboot your VPS which could happen at any point.

**Something new:**  
You can optionally upgrade certain feature such RAM, Bandwidth, IPs, and Drive Space.  
You can run virtualized environments within your VPS.

**Intel Xeon Processors**  
The host machines have one of the following. If you have a preference I can try to make sure you get the one you want.

Dual Intel Xeon E5-2680  
Dual Intel Xeon Silver 4310

**VPN Users:**

If you are using a VPN to hide your location then it will probably get marked as fraud.  
If your address is in one country but your ip is in another country it will probably get marked as fraud.  
If you try to signup from a hosting provider it will probably get marked as fraud.

Maxmind uses a bunch of things for fraud scoring. If you don't pass the fraud check then I probably will not approve the order.

**AUP:**  
You must also abide by Cogent's AUP <https://www.cogentco.com/en/acceptable-use-policy>

**There are no refunds after 30 days of service.** If you pay for 6 months and want to cancel after 3 months you will not get a partial refund. Only cancellations within 30 days of the start of service qualify for a refund.

**Very Important:**  
Check your ping times to 38.45.64.1. You may be too far away to use this service effectively.

**All of the packages are listed here:**
