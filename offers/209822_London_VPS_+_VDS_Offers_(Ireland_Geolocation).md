# London VPS + VDS Offers (Ireland Geolocation)
**Link:** [Original Thread](https://lowendtalk.com/discussion/209822/london-vps-vds-offers-ireland-geolocation)

AVS ISP is offering high-performance VPS and VDS hosting out of London, with Irish geolocated IPs. Perfect if you want low-latency UK connectivity while avoiding UK-specific censorship.

All plans run on enterprise-grade hardware powered by Intel Xeon Gold CPUs, NVMe storage, and Proxmox virtualization — giving you full control via the Proxmox panel. Our network is backed by very large uplink pipes, with XDP-based DDoS protection, ensuring speed and stability even under heavy load.

All plans will come with the settings CPU host to passthrough host CPU specs to VM. rDNS is possible via ticket. All VMs come with a /48 of IPv6 and 1 IPv4 address.

Plans are stock-limited - first-come, first-serve. If one plan is sold-out, feel free to take another. This is to avoid overselling and we do not add stock back until someone else has cancelled or not extended theirs of that size.

### Notes / Rules

* IPs are geolocated to Ireland
* Tor is allowed, but Exit Nodes are not. If we find your IP listed as an Exit, the VM may be suspended until the Exit service is disabled.
* Unmetered Bandwidth - For us, that means we do not impose strict limits. We do not however allow abuse. We allow you to download as much as you want. If we detect sustained large outbound usage with minimal inbound, we may reach out to verify the purpose. In rare cases of suspected abuse, outbound may be rate-limited to protect the network.
* We respect your privacy. We don’t monitor your data, look into (or even scan) your file, and don’t care what you run (within the rules stated before for Tor) — as long as it 1) doesn’t affect the network and 2) doesn’t bring unwanted legal complaints. In return, we ask that you respect us by not causing issues that force us to intervene.
* Setup is done within 24 hours, but usually a lot faster. We work between 9AM and 9PM CEST (Central European Time). For those that need 24/7 support, WhatsApp or Telegram can be given for direct support contact on request.
