🛠️ **Important Notes**
======================

As with all BF/CM events:

* Stock is limited and promotions may change or expire at any time.
* Provisioning may be delayed during high-order volume, fraud checks, or when deploying new hardware.
* Support will respond as quickly as possible — thank you for your patience!

Additionally:

* Although we are limiting this sale to a few US locations to test the waters, we plan on enabling additional locations soon!
* We are working on adding OS selection to the ordering process. For now, all VPS are provisioned with AlmaLinux, which you can reinstall in the control panel with another OS after ordering.
* Since this is our first BF/CM on LET in a long while, please excuse any minor hiccups, and as always, feel free to provide feedback! We hope to be back next year for more deals! ![:wink:](https://lowendtalk.com/resources/emoji/wink.png ":wink:")
