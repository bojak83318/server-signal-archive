**How to pick the right CloudCone server for your website?**

**Performance:**  
Our VPS line is perfect for general purpose computing, while our SC2 servers can scale up as your application grows. You can also opt for our CDN to boost load times worldwide.

**Security:**  
VPSs and SC2s come with a Cloud Firewall for added security, especially when you need to whitelist public access to handle sensitive data. You can also add DDoS protection to an SC2 instance for an extra layer of protection.

**Scalability:**  
With the SC2 line, resources can be scaled independently based on traffic and growth. For example, if your online store grows, you can easily upgrade the SC2 instance for your e-commerce sites without affecting the site’s uptime.

**Ease of Management:**  
Having dedicated environments for static and dynamic sites makes updates, backups, and troubleshooting much simpler. A cost-effective VPS instance can handle static sites, while high-performance SC2 servers can provide the demanding sites with the resources and extra features (auto-backups, DDoS IPs, etc) they need.

To keep things straightforward, we recommend:  
**VPS product line:** for general purpose usage that don’t require much oversight after deployment.  
**SC2 product line:** for demanding workloads, needing resource scalability, continuous backups for sensitive data, and on-demand server management and support.

Together with an international team of in-house DevOps Engineers and Support, we provide 24/7 Cloud Support via tickets for all our clients. As always, we listen to all of the feedback provided and continuously attempt to improve our services to match our overall customer demands better.
