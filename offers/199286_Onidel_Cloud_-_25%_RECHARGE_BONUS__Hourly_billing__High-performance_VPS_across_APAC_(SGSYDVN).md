❔ FAQ
=====

**Q: How hourly billing works?**  
**A**: Please have a read <https://docs.onidel.com/features/hourly-billing>  
  
  
**Q: Can I add a credit card to my account and be charged later?**  
**A**: No, currently we deduct hourly charges directly from your account balance. We are working on adding a credit card payment option in the future.  
  
  
**Q: Why do I have to verify my phone number?**  
**A**: Phone number verification is only required if you wish to use hourly billing VMs. This is our initial step to help prevent abuse.  
  
  
**Q: How can I verify my phone number?**  
**A**: When you log into our panel, you'll be prompted to verify your phone number. Please follow the instructions provided. We use Telegram to send the verification code, so if you don’t already have an account, please create a free Telegram account with your mobile number.  
  
  
**Q: Can I scale up or scale down my VMs?**  
**A**: Yes, with hourly billing, you can upgrade or downgrade your VMs at any time. Please note that disk size can only be increased, not decreased. For subscription-based VMs, only upgrades are currently allowed, but enabling downgrades is a priority we are actively working on. Please see <https://docs.onidel.com/features/vm-scaling> for more details.  
  
  
**Q: Is rDNS supported?**  
**A**: Yes, you can manage rDNS directly in our panel.  
  
  
**Q: Is IPv6 available?**  
**A**: Routed /64 per VM is available in Singapore and Sydney and can be enabled during provisioning or later using our panel. In Vietnam we only support /112 on-link IPv6.  
  
  
**Q: What networks and datacenters do you use?**  
**A**: For information on data centers and looking glasses, please visit <https://docs.onidel.com/information/datacenters>. We maintain redundancy at each location, and our IP transit provider (Host Universal) connects to at least two upstream networks at every site. All hypervisors are equipped with dual fiber network connections to separate switches, ensuring your VMs remain connected even in the event of a switch failure.   
  
  
**Q: How is bandwidth usage calculated?**  
**A**: We calculate your bandwidth usage based on both inbound and outbound traffic. Traffic in the private network interface is not counted.  
  
  
**Q: What happens if my bandwidth usage exceeds the limits?**  
**A**: For subscription-based VMs, network speed will be capped at 5Mbps. For hourly billing VMs, an overage charge of A$0.01 per GB will apply.  
  
  
**Q: What is Ceph NVMe SSD block storage?**  
**A**: We use Ceph, a distributed storage cluster that provides a scalable, fault-tolerant, and highly available storage solution. All data is replicated across at least three nodes, ensuring that even in the event of disk or node failures, your data remains safe and accessible without delay.  
  
  
**Q: Do you offer refunds ?**  
**A**: No, we do not offer refunds. However, we are committed to ensuring customer satisfaction and will do our best to resolve any issues you may encounter. We provide looking glasses and test files, so please take the time to review these resources to confirm our service meets your needs before placing an order.
