● Development & DevOps Workflows: Deploy tailored test and production servers with precise CPU, RAM, and storage to streamline CI/CD pipelines and container orchestration.  
● SaaS Startups & Growing Platforms: Start lean with minimal investment, then scale compute, memory, or storage as your user base expands, with no migration required.
