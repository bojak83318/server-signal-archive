I have some free rent to own servers available - Why RENT when you can OWN?

How it works: You pay for colo for 6 months ($59/mo), then at the end of the 6 months you are welcome to continue paying for the same colo cost, or move you hardware out! At the end of the 6 months the hardware is yours to choose what to do with it!

Yes, you can ship in upgrades and we can process those upgrades for you
