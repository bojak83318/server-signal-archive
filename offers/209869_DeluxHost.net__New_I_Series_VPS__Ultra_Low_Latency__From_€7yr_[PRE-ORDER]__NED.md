⚡ Amsterdam VPS – New I Series Launch ⚡
=======================================

We’re excited to introduce our brand-new **I Series**, available now in limited stock straight from AMS.

We know that some of our recent launches have looked familiar, and that’s true. This is because we’re currently in a transition phase, carefully preparing for something much bigger, which will be released **shortly after the beginning of the new year**. It’s a project the community has been asking for a long time, and we want to take the time to do it properly, with the quality you expect from us.

In the meantime, our current offers continue to sell out quickly, showing how valued they remain.

### Recent improvements include:

✅ **Fair Use Policy doubled**, giving everyone more flexibility  
✅ **Latency halved** towards Asia and the United States, even better in Europe  
✅ **More IX connections and an increased number of peers**, significantly strengthening our network  
✅ Same unbeatable prices, solid and ready-to-go performance

🚨 **Stock is limited**: once it’s gone, you’ll need to wait for the next round.

📦 **PRE-ORDER ONLY, DELIVERY WITHIN 14 DAYS**

### ✅ All plans include

1× IPv4 & 1× /64 IPv6,  
Maximum stability & performance,  
Free backups included,  
Basic DDoS Protection,  
BGP session available (upon request, with a onetime fee)
