Another achievement: some customers requested it, and we made it happen, even though it wasn't easy. We're back in Bulgaria. We already have VPS, but now we have dedicated servers in Bulgaria! That's right.

From now on, we have servers available in Bulgaria, and more will be added depending on our stock. For now, we only have one dedicated server model available.´

And if you’re ready to try it, now’s the perfect time.

Note: Due to the price exceeding the limit. We won't post links.

A great way to experience the new lineup firsthand.  
Valid until October 31.
