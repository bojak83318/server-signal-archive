Hi All,

I am excited to introduce [VM6 Networks](https://www.vm6.co.uk "VM6 Networks") brand-new UK EPYC VPS lineup, now live from London and powered by AMD EPYC 4464P. These new nodes bring DDR5 memory, 10Gbps ports with guaranteed 2Gbps throughput, improved DDoS protection, and a full IPv6 /64 subnet included. It’s a big step up from our previous Ryzen 9 5900X setup—offering up to 21% better multi-threaded performance and a more stable, server-grade platform built for serious workloads.

If you’ve been running on our Ryzen-based VPS and want to stick with that platform, good news: we still have a limited stpcl available. However once they’re gone, they’re gone—so grab one while you can.
