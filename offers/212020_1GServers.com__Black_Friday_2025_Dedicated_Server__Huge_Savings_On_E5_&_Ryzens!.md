**Exciting 1GServers 2025 Black Friday Server Deals Await!**

Black Friday is here, and we’re celebrating by dropping some of the most aggressive dedicated server deals we’ve ever released on 1GServers. Every offer below is powered by our premium, non oversold Phoenix network! This is the same high performance backbone trusted by our CDN, streaming, and high bandwidth customers. These are not watered down specials or old stock clear outs, rather these are full power machines with massive bandwidth allocations, real 10Gbps connectivity, and enterprise grade stability. If you've been waiting for a chance to grab a serious server at an absurd price point, this is it.

Each configuration is available in very limited supply, built specifically for the LET community, and priced far below our standard recurring rates. Once these units are taken, they’re gone!

We won’t be restocking at these levels. Whether you're looking for top tier Ryzen performance or incredible value from our legacy Dual E5 lineup, these deals deliver exceptional compute, storage, and bandwidth at a fraction of the normal cost. Grab one before the inventory disappears!

**📍 Why Choose Us?**

1GServers has been delivering high-quality dedicated servers since 2012, specializing in high-bandwidth, mission-critical workloads. When you choose us, you’re partnering with a provider that understands your needs and scales with your growth.
