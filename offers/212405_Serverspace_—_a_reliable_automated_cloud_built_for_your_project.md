We’re **[Serverspace](http://serverspace.team/ "Serverspace")**, a next-generation cloud platform for developers, startups, and IT teams who value flexibility, transparency, and stability.

Unlike traditional VPS providers, we don’t use fixed plans. You build the exact VM configuration you need — choosing your CPU, RAM, storage, and bandwidth. Traffic is completely unlimited, both inbound and outbound. You pay only for the resources you actually use. Scaling takes just a few clicks in the control panel.

We offer virtual servers on two virtualization platforms: vStack (Bhyve-based) and VMware ESXi, so you can pick the environment that best fits your workload and tech stack.

We operate in five countries — the US, the Netherlands, Brazil, Canada, and Kazakhstan. Each region works as a fully local provider with billing in the local currency, independent of USD exchange rates. Prices stay stable even when the market doesn’t, unlike with many global hosts.

You also get fast server deployment, an intuitive control panel, API access, a 24/7 support team, and a global CDN for instant content delivery worldwide.

If you need cloud infrastructure that adapts to your project — welcome to Serverspace.
