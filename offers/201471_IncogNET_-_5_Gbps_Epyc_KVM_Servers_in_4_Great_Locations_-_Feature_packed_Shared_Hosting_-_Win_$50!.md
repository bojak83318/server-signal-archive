Hey all, MannDude here. If you've not already gone broke throwing money at random Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and Christmas deals then you may find yourself seeking *moar*. Currently we're sitting with some limited VPS stock in all four of our locations and with an excessive amount of new CloudLinux Shared hosting stock in our Kansas City location and have an enticing offer for those seeking a quality product that will continue to serve you well now, and into the future.

---

**But first, a brief history:**

I started IncogNET in 2020 after observing a radical lack of support for privacy and free speech from service providers both big and small. This all began with a simple belief that an ISP should operate apolitically, following the laws of the land that they operate in and that additional rules for moderation of content that is not already prohibited by law was excessive and unnecessary. Furthermore, in an age where online privacy was becoming more and more scarce and dataleaks of personal information was becoming more and more prevalent, it was decided that only the bare minimum should be required for service which is why only an email address is required for registration. Other providers want your full name, address, phone, and ID scans. Do you trust their 3rd party outsourced support team to verify your information? Do you trust that these no-name providers who pop up overnight with your identifiable information? Do you think that they have proper safeguards in place to prevent unauthorized staff from reviewing this data, or that it will be removed after verification?

With us, we don't ask for these details. I'm not going to call you and wish you happy birthday. I'm not going to mail you a Christmas card. Non-invasive ordering processes should be the norm, not the exception, which is why we don't get upset when we see that many people have copied our setup and have done the same as us.

So hey, we may not be the cheapest in town. I don't have money to do a TV giveaway or throw a Nintendo Switch at you for some random post engagement. But what I do have to offer is this: Quality services at a reasonable price from a brand that will be here for a long time. This is a niche area of the market and not served well by anyone else on LowEndTalk.

✅ Non-invasive, privacy respecting ordering process.  
✅ Enterprise quality hardware, always.  
✅ Ultra fast, non-congested 5Gbps connectivity in every location!  
✅ External VPS firewall, a new feature now available in all locations!  
✅ 4 Great locations available across the USA and Europe.  
✅ Dual Stack Networking. It's 2025, of course we've got IPv6!  
✅ We're not resellers. We own our IPs and ASN, and our hardware is fully owned (Kansas City) or custom builds that we lease (other location).  
✅ Many Linux OS templates available, or use Windows (Bring your own key) or upload your own ISO!  
✅ Many more features!

While we do not often do many LowEndTalk promotions, I have reviewed our most used promotional codes for active orders in 2024. Although our most active and used code was for 30% off any annually paid service, this was not shared or used on LowEndTalk as it's *"not enough"* of a discount for you fine people. So let's try this, as a LowEndTalk exclusive: 50% off any VPS plan or term, using code: `KVMLET2025`. This is limited in number to just 20 uses.

The coupon code is recurring for the life of your product / service in your account.

Currently only available in our 🇺🇸 Kansas City, Missouri and 🇳🇱 Naaldwijk, Netherlands locations, we plan on expanding our offering to our Liberty Lake, Washington and Allentown, Pennsylvania location in the coming month or so. (Likely have Allentown in the coming weeks, hopefully!)

This is very feature rich shared hosting using DirectAdmin. We've had very stable pricing over the years without the headache of increased costs like many cPanel hosts and find DirectAdmin to be superior in almost every way when it comes to general end-user experience. No annoying control panel pop-ups for the file manager, no assinine work flows to do simple things like install a free SSL Certificate from LetsEncrypt. Things like webmail, FTP accounts, adding a domain and more are all just *right there*, easy to find and simple to use.

We're offering 50% off the cost of our CloudLinux Shared Hosting plans as well! Use coupon code: `SHAREDLET2025` to get the plans and pricing shown below!

GIVEAWAY
--------

Share a YouTube video you like, a meme that made you laugh, a recipe for meatloaf... I don't care. The entire point of these garbage engagement posts is to keep a provider's advertisement on the front page with minimal effort, so why not take advantage of the rules that allow such nonsense? I only ask that you abide by the forum rules and that you do not comment twice in a row. So, add worthless pointless bumps and 'user engagement'. You could win $50 in account credit and I get more eyes on my ad. **Contest ends on Friday, January 10th at 1PM EST**. I'll choose a winner at random after that.
