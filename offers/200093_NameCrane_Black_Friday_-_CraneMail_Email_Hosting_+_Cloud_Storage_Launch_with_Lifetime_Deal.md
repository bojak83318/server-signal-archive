CraneMail Features
==================

![https://files.namecrane.com/cranemail/CraneMail-menus.jpg](https://files.namecrane.com/cranemail/CraneMail-menus.jpg)

### **Professional Business Email Suite with Collaboration Features**

Fully featured business mail suite with all the fixings - cloud file storage & folder sharing, contact and calendar sharing, chat, online meetings (voice/video), tasklist management/notes, and much more. Powered by SmarterMail, you can dive into the [full feature set and documentation here](https://www.smartertools.com/smartermail/business-email-server "full feature set and documentation here").

### **Amazing Webmail Experience**

![](https://files.namecrane.com/cranemail/CraneMail-accept-calendar-invite.jpg)  
The webmail user experience has been a huge hit with our beta testers, offering a much more Outlook-like experience for email. Mail, contacts, calendars, online meetings and tasks are closely integrated as you’d expect with something like Google Workspace.

Get more details on the [webmail features and additional screenshots here](https://www.smartertools.com/smartermail/webmail-client "webmail features and additional screenshots here").

### **Included Cloud Storage**

![](https://files.namecrane.com/cranemail/CraneMail-files.jpg)  
All plans offer a combined amount of storage for mail and files. Easily upload and share large files with family/coworkers or in email/publicly via URL. WebDAV support is still being developed but will be available in the future, so you can utilize the storage with rClone and other desktop sync tools.

Cloud connect features let you sign into your existing cloud storage accounts and browse/manage files, plus copy them over to your CraneMail account.

![](https://files.namecrane.com/cranemail/CraneMail-cloud-connect.jpg)

### **IMAP/SMTP/POP Support, plus free eM Client Pro licenses**

Standard mail options for utilizing the service with your own clients. Also, each domain gets access to 3 free Pro licenses for [eM Client](https://www.emclient.com/ "eM Client").

![](https://files.namecrane.com/cranemail/CraneMail-domain-admin-emclient.jpg)

### **Built-in Mail Migration**

Easily move your mailboxes from your existing providers with the built-in mail migration tool. Provide your existing email account’s login details, or authenticate your gmail/outlook/etc accounts, and start a bulk mail move from your current mail provider that runs in the background.

Gmail/Google Workspace, Outlook/Office365, and standard mail providers with IMAP have worked excellently for our beta testers. iCloud mail migrations haven’t been as successful though.

### **Premium Spam Filtering from SpamExperts**

Bundled with every CraneMail account is spam filtering from SpamExperts. Filtering is done via our on-prem SpamExperts nodes. You get access to the control panel to tune spam filtering settings, release/train mail, and more.

### **Great Email Deliverability**

Mail is sent via our own spam filtering outbound relays to retain our clean sender reputation and make sure the mail we send ends up in the recipient's inbox. We’ve built a sufficient reputation with large mail providers in the last few months and feel confident in our ability to deliver your messages.

Our default sending limits are 300 emails/hour per domain. This isn’t a service for bulk mailing, marketing emails, etc - it’s a primarily inbound business/personal email hosting service.

### **No Per-Mailbox Costs, Easy Administration**

![](https://files.namecrane.com/cranemail/CraneMail-domain-admin-users.jpg)

Your domain administrator access allows you to easily add, impersonate (login as), and manage your users. We don’t limit mailboxes so you can create as many as you need without increasing your bill.

Primary domains allowed on each plan are effectively separate overall accounts per-domain. These are limited based on the size of plan you purchase. We don’t limit domain aliases (multiple domains attached to the same mailboxes).

### **Other Features That Set CraneMail Apart**

* 2-Factor Authentication for Webmail
* Voice/Video/Text chat (XMPP/Jabber) with external client support, file sharing w/ previews
* Contact & Calendar Sharing, full CardDAV/CalDAV support
* Fetch emails from your mailboxes with other email providers - [screenshot](https://files.namecrane.com/cranemail/CraneMail-email-retrieval.jpg)
* OnlyOffice web-based document editing for documents/spreadsheets/presentations (BETA)
* Email archiving - keep an extra copy of in/outbound mail for certain mailboxes, so you never accidentally delete a message (counted against main storage)
* Simple unsubscribe for newsletters/mailing lists
* Much much much more. Seriously we can’t list it all, this would be 10x as long. [Check out SmarterMail’s site for the full feature set](https://www.smartertools.com/smartermail/business-email-server "Check out SmarterMail’s site for the full feature set").

### **Technical Details**

CraneMail nodes use ZFS-backed storage with mirrored NVMe storage for mail. Offsite backups are taken daily for disaster recovery purposes only - not individual account restores or accidental email deletion (use the Email Archiving feature!). Backup frequency will increase in coming months. 10 gigabit networking for fast uploads/file sharing.

At launch CraneMail is only available in our US (Las Vegas) datacenter.

Reseller Plans
==============

We’re also launching reseller plans today which include all of the above features, but allow you to resell custom plans to your own clients. We’re proud of the feature set as it stands, but are still actively developing reseller functionality.

### **White Label Server Names & Login Page URL**

Domains selected/connected to the service are whitelabeled, plus as a reseller you have the ability to create a custom login page on your domain. Your customers can easily login to their webmail/administration or SpamExperts directly.

As we add servers/locations, the login page will stay the same and allow for a single point of login no matter which server a specific client is on. Branding, customization and more for this page is currently being developed.

![](https://files.namecrane.com/cranemail/CraneMail-custom-login-page.jpg)

### **Extensive Plan Customization & Upsell Potential**

Create very precise, custom plans for your clients and upsell them on the features we include. Limit accounts by the standard specs: disk space, mailbox count, and aliases. You can also include or upsell specific features like email archiving, SpamExperts filtering, cloud/file storage features, and the (still in beta) online document editing.

### **WHMCS & Blesta Billing Modules**

Francisco has been working hard the past week and launched both WHMCS and Blesta billing modules so you can easily deploy, modify, suspend, and terminate customer accounts.

Modules are available on the NameCrane Github:  
[WHMCS Module](https://github.com/namecrane/cranemail-whmcs-module "WHMCS Module")  
[Blesta Module](https://github.com/namecrane/cranemail-blesta-module "Blesta Module")

Reseller Launch Discount
------------------------

As we’re still actively building out the reseller featureset to allow more tweaking and customization we’re extending a first invoice launch discount.

Use the coupon `mailresellerlaunch30` for a 30% discount on your first invoice - any sized plan, any billing term.
