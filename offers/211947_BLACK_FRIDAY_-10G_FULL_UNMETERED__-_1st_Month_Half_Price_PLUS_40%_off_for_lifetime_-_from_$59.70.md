F.A.Q.
------

Q. How long will my server take to be delivered?  
A. Instant buy servers are instant on payment. Custom servers normally require 24-72 hours. If the Base model/CPU is not listed under instant buy the lead time may be longer.  
Q. Do you ignore DMCA complaints.  
A. All DMCA and abuse complaints can be viewed and acknowledged through the control panel. As long as complaints are not excessive, no further action will be taken.  
Q. Can I use these servers for scanning or attacks?  
A. This activity generates abuse complaints. If you do not resolve these then you may get permanent suspension.  
Q. Can I bring my own IP's, ASN or have BGP  
A. Yes! With your own IP's you also can manage your own abuse complaints reducing the risk of suspension.
