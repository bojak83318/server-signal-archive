# $2.00 Mystery Box Dedicated Servers (Cheaper Dedicated with a Twist)
**Link:** [Original Thread](https://lowendtalk.com/discussion/209006/2-00-mystery-box-dedicated-servers-cheaper-dedicated-with-a-twist)

Hey LET,

We’re rolling out something new at BreezeHost that we think some of you will find interesting — it’s called the **Mystery Box Dedicated Server**.

Here’s how it works:

* You pick a pre-packaged server configuration (CPU/RAM/Storage).
* We provision it for you in one of our U.S. data centers (Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, Miami, Portland, Salt Lake City, New York, Washington DC)
* You don’t pick the city — but you save money compared to our regular dedicated lineup.

So basically:  
✅ Guaranteed dedicated hardware (no shared resources)  
✅ Lower prices for the same specs  
✅ Provisioned quickly in any of our U.S. locations (Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, Miami, Portland, Salt Lake City, New York, Washington DC)  
✅ You just don’t control which city it lands in

We built this for people who don’t really care where the server is hosted — as long as it’s in the U.S. and reliable — but want better pricing on dedicated hardware.

👉 Full details and order link: <https://breezehost.io/mysterybox>  
USE COUPON CODE: "LUCKYSERVER" to take advantage of intro pricing: **$2.00 for your first month!**

Would love to hear feedback from the community on whether this “random location for lower cost” model is useful to you, or if you’d prefer to stick with location-specific orders.
