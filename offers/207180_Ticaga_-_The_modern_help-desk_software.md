**Why try Ticaga?**  
I know we're new, but my focus is on Ticaga and I want to make it my full time career, I've got so much planned, I've put in so much time, hard work and care that I'm happy with it as it is now to introduce the world to my software and company.

****What happened to version 1?****   
I started Ticaga in 2018/2019, and I coded it myself from scratch. Through looking at competitors and how I could improve the software they use, I made the decision to use Laravel.

This was a great move! When Laravel 12 came out, I loved the design and I changed it to Laravel 12, this became version 2.

I did this because I re-wrote the base code to implement roles. I removed the Jetstream Teams feature that I was trying to get set-up as companies because it wasn't used. However as Jetstream is EOL, I need to implement 2FA and the API Hash again. (This is a priority for me to do in 2.1.0.)

****Are you going to get rid of the Owned licenses like other competitors?****   
Other companies such as SupportPal and Kayako have abolished their owned licenses, I will not be doing that. I believe if you purchase an Owned license, you have put your trust in my business and you will always be able to use your copy of Ticaga.

****Premium Support?****.   
With Premium support, you get an assigned Account Manager who you will have a direct line to. You can contact your account manager whenever you need, either by phone or opening a ticket. Premium support also offers you support outside of the standard opening hours, giving you a bit more of a personal touch.
