Hello LowEndTalk!

I'm excited to introduce **HostBilby Inc.** a new name on the block, backed by years of experience, technical know how, and a genuine commitment to providing top tier services!

[www.hostbilby.com](https://www.hostbilby.com "www.hostbilby.com")

I specialize in quality Web Hosting, VPS and Dedicated Servers, with infrastructure designed from the ground up to deliver reliability, speed and performance. I'm leveraging some awesome Control Panels in the industry with VirtFusion for VPS, Enhance for our Web Hosting offerings and TenantOS for Dedicated Servers. Each platform has a stellar offering, that I'm committed to and excited by!

My first location went live in Spokane, Washington (USA) in March 2025, followed by Valley Forge, Pennsylvania in May 2025. Following the success of the first two locations (no thanks to a certain upstream ![B)](https://lowendtalk.com/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png "B)") ). I'm now proud to have launched the third location in Toronto, Canada (My home city). In Toronto, I'm live with my own rack, Arista networking and an excellent transit provider, peering and more on the way!

I also have a Discord where some other Flash Deals will get posted over the coming days: <https://discord.gg/hFK8JF8gQP>

🌎 IPv6 /64 routed per VPS, with full rDNS support on both v4 & v6.

👷‍♂️ Custom ISOs are self service - no tickets required.

☎️ Real world, flexible abuse handling - accidental high usage won't get you suspended instantly. I'll work with you.

🐶 Who "We" Are
--------------

HostBilby is a small but focused company registered in 2025 - right now, it's proudly owned and operated by two people, My Wife and Myself (Nate 👷‍♂️), an Australian with a 20 year career in infrastructure, tech ops and (quite a while ago) web hosting.

The company is registered and based in Ontario, Canada, with global infrastructure ambitions already underway. We're debt free, with intention to always own our Infrastructure, however in the spirit of transparency - a few of our Shared Web Hosting locations are currently powered by other providers as we scale and some of our IP ranges are rented from a trusted source (Because ARIN can be a pain and we aren't quite ready to own them yet) - we fully intend to migrate these to our own Hardware Colocated, asap.

This isn't a big faceless brand - it's a personal, hands on operation built with care and attention to detail. Everything - from server builds to platform configuration and customer support - is done in house with a clear goal: to provide solid, no nonsense Web Hosting, VPS & Dedicated Servers that don't cut corners.

If you're someone who values transparency and likes supporting small, growing providers who are building something for the long haul - I hope HostBilby earns your trust.

🛜 The Infrastructure & Network Approach
---------------------------------------

I've partnered with some strong and amazing providers who support us as remote hands with our Colocation in the USA - along with providing solid upstream to announce our AS and IP blocks. This strategy has allowed me to focus on delivering rock solid hardware and support along with development iteration of our offering in the first almost 12 months.

I own our AS number ([AS401665](https://bgp.tools/as/401665 "AS401665")) and most v4 + v6 blocks. We're in the process of transferring some older resources from an old Sole Prop (AS401619).

Our upstream in the USA and IP Transit in Canada don't rely solely on Cogent (AS174) or HE (AS1299) and both have diversity in place.

I'm planning to bring in BGP sessions and RPKI support as HostBilby scales into Toronto in future.

---

🧑‍🚀 Support That's Honest & Human
---------------------------------

Support is available 7 days a week, 9 AM to 9 PM Eastern Time via ticket.

As a small operator, the aim is for a reasonable turnaround - not instant replies, but typically responses within a few hours. Every ticket is handled personally and with care by me (For now! I'll bring on additional team members as makes sense).

No outsourced responses. No scripted nonsense. Just honest help when you need it (within reason).

---

🤗 I'd really Appreciate Your Thoughts
-------------------------------------

I'm here to build something long term - and LET is filled with experienced users who know what makes a great provider.

I'd love to know:

* What matters most to you when picking a VPS or Dedicated Server provider?
* What makes you stay with a host?
* What kind of Hardware would you love to see me deploy next?
* What additional locations would you like to see us live in?
