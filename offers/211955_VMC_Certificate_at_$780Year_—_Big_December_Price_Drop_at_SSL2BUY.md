# VMC Certificate at $780/Year — Big December Price Drop at SSL2BUY
**Link:** [Original Thread](https://lowendtalk.com/discussion/211955/vmc-certificate-at-780-year-big-december-price-drop-at-ssl2buy)

Just sharing a useful deal for anyone working on BIMI / DMARC implementation or planning Verified Mark Certificates soon.

SSL2BUY is now offering [BIMI Certificates at $780/year](https://www.ssl2buy.com/prime-vmc-certificate "BIMI Certificates at $780/year").  
For context, DigiCert VMC is $1499+, so this is a pretty big gap if you’re handling multiple sending domains or managing branding at scale.

This includes:

* Verified logo + Gmail blue check
* BIMI-compliant SVG logo support
* DMARC enforcement guidance
* 24/7 Human assistance
* 30-Day money-back option

It works the same way - verified logo display, BIMI compliance, trademark validation, and inbox trust improvements - but at a much more reasonable cost.

If you’ve been waiting for a good price window, this might be worth looking at.
