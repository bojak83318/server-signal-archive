Hello LET,

We are once again ready to celebrate Black Friday with awesome deals!

*But why should you chose HostBrr?*

Well, we can let the deals speak for themselves!

But to put a few words into it, then HostBrr prides itself at offering cutting edge performance at truly affordable prices. No more buying hosting plans with unknown CPU models only to be disappointed that your provider is still using decades old Intel Xeon CPUs. Since our inception we've been using the latest generations of high performance CPUs. Combine this with rock-solid uptime and great human support then you got yourself the recipe for a provider you want to stick with!

**Important information**

1. Provision time: 1-24 hours.
2. Black Friday offers are non-transferable.
3. 48 hour refund period.
4. Unpaid offers will be canceled

HDD Block Storage
=================

During our Black Friday deals we are offering HDD block storage at a unheard price of just €1/month per TB. Add up to 10 TB of storage for just €10/month! This offer is valid on many of our VPS packages! Just use the slider at checkout to add storage.

The price is recurring as long as your service is active!

HDD Block Storage is suitable for media servers, general storage, backups and so on. You will be disappointed if you use it for latency sensitive work or small 4K files, such as databases or S3 storage.
