**Before we begin, a quick general FAQ:**
=========================================

* All pricing is in EUR
* All pricing is VAT Excl, unless otherwise stated
* VAT will be charged to EU residents, living outside of Bulgaria, with no valid VAT number. VAT will not be charged to customers from outside the EU.
* All Black Friday sales are non-refundable and come with limited support
* All orders need to contain valid contact information, otherwise will be rejected.
* All Black Friday specials can not be transferred. Please do not buy with the intention to resell - that's not going to happen this time around. Changing account details with the intention to transfer would also not be possible and would render the service to be terminated.
* All orders are subject to a manual review. Anonymous orders are not allowed.
* Orders with fake addresses with the intention to avoid VAT would be rejected. Further orders won't be allowed
* All orders are set up after a review - they are not instantly set up. In all cases, you will receive your server in a very timely matter. Dedicated server deployment is between 1 hour and 24 hours.
* VPS Offers do not come with a dedicated CPU. These are fair shares.
* Custom ISO is possible, via a ticket for any KVM plan
* These are not intended to replace existing services. That being said - we can't help you migrate from one service to another.
* These offers are not upgradeable. Choose wisely - we won't be able to upgrade/downgrade you are a later stage!
* Orders not paid within 15 minutes will be canceled.
* **Dedicated servers are limited to 1 order per customer**

**Let's get the party started!**
