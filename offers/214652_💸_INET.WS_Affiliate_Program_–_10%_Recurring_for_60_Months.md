**Link:** [Original Thread](https://lowendtalk.com/discussion/214652/inet-ws-affiliate-program-10-recurring-for-60-months)

Hey LET,

We’ve launched an affiliate program for our VPS services and wanted to share it here.

What you get:

✔ 10% recurring commission  
✔ Paid for up to 60 months per client  
✔ Commission applies to all valid payments

📌 More Details

Full program terms are available at:  
<https://cloud.inet.ws/affiliatepolicy/>

Payout:

* Minimum withdrawal: $100
* PayPal payments
* Processed within 10 business days

No gimmicks — just recurring revenue for sending real customers.

Allowed traffic: blogs, communities, content sites, legit marketing.  
Not allowed: spam, self-referrals, fraudulent signups.

If you already discuss VPS / hosting here or run related traffic, this could be an easy additional revenue stream.

PM me if you want details or affiliate access.
