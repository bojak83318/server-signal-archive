CraneMail Features
==================

FTP(S)/SFTP/Rclone Support for Cloud Storage (BETA)
---------------------------------------------------

Get the most out of your CraneMail cloud storage by easily accessing and managing it over FTPS or SFTP with your favorite client.

Rclone support is also available via our [custom build available on our GitHub](https://github.com/namecrane/rclone/releases/).

Z-Push (ActiveSync) - iOS Push for Email/Contacts/Calendar
----------------------------------------------------------

Z-Push available on all CraneMail plans. Z-Push is an open source ActiveSync implementation that allows you to get push notifications for emails on your iOS/Android mail clients as well as faster contact/calendar syncing.

Amazing Webmail Experience
--------------------------

![](https://files.namecrane.com/cranemail/CraneMail-accept-calendar-invite.jpg)

Webmail, contacts, calendars, online meetings and tasks are closely integrated as you’d expect with something like Google Workspace. Get more details on the [webmail features and additional screenshots here](https://www.smartertools.com/smartermail/webmail-client).

We also offer Roundcube access now if that's more your speed.

Included Cloud Storage
----------------------

![](https://files.namecrane.com/cranemail/CraneMail-files.jpg)  
All plans offer a combined amount of storage for mail and files. Easily upload and share large files with family/coworkers or in email/publicly via URL. WebDAV support is still being developed but will be available in the future, so you can utilize the storage with rClone and other desktop sync tools.

Cloud connect features let you sign into your existing cloud storage accounts and browse/manage files, plus copy them over to your CraneMail account.

Supported Email Protocols
-------------------------

Beyond the great webmail you obviously get access to a bunch of protocols so you can use your CraneMail plan with any email client:

* IMAP
* POP
* SMTP
* MAPI + EWS
* EAS via Z-PUSH (ActiveSync)

Premium Spam Filtering from SpamExperts
---------------------------------------

Bundled with every CraneMail account is spam filtering from SpamExperts. Filtering is done via our on-prem SpamExperts nodes. You get access to the control panel to tune spam filtering settings, release/train mail, and more.

Free eM Client Pro License (3 Devices)
--------------------------------------

![](https://files.namecrane.com/cranemail/CraneMail-domain-admin-emclient.jpg)

Each Primary Domain gets access to an eM Client license good for 3 device activations. eM client is a desktop and mobile email client that tightly integrates with SmarterMail. We've found it to be a fantastic Outlook alternative.

Built-in Mail Migration
-----------------------

Easily move your mail from your existing provider with the built-in mail migration tool. Provide your existing email account’s login details, or authenticate your gmail/outlook/etc accounts, and start a bulk mail move from your current mail provider that runs in the background.

Great Email Deliverability
--------------------------

Mail is sent via our own spam filtering outbound relays to retain our clean sender reputation and make sure the mail we send ends up in the recipient's inbox. We’ve built a strong, positive reputation with large & small mail providers over the last year and you can feel confident in our ability to deliver your messages.

Our default sending limits are 600 emails/hour per domain. This isn’t a service for bulk mailing, marketing emails, etc - it’s a primarily inbound business/personal email hosting service.

No Per-Mailbox Costs, Easy Administration
-----------------------------------------

![](https://files.namecrane.com/cranemail/CraneMail-domain-admin-users.jpg)

Your domain administrator access allows you to easily add mailboxes/aliases and manage domain settings. We don’t limit mailboxes so you can create as many as you need without increasing your bill.

Primary domains allowed on each plan are effectively separate overall accounts per-domain. These are limited based on the size of plan you purchase. We don’t limit domain aliases (multiple domains attached to the same mailboxes).

More Great CraneMail Features
-----------------------------

* 2-Factor Authentication for Webmail
* Fetch emails from your mailboxes with other email providers, send-as via their SMTP - [screenshot](https://files.namecrane.com/cranemail/CraneMail-email-retrieval.jpg)
* OnlyOffice web-based document editing for documents/spreadsheets/presentations
* Contact & Calendar Sharing, full CardDAV/CalDAV support
* Email archiving - keep an extra copy of in/outbound mail for certain mailboxes, so you never accidentally delete a message (counted against main storage)
* And much much more. [Check out SmarterMail’s site for the full feature set](https://www.smartertools.com/smartermail/business-email-server).

Technical Details
-----------------

CraneMail nodes use ZFS-backed storage with mirrored NVMe's for mail. Local snapshots are taken multiple times per hour, with offsite backups multiple times a day. Our backups are for disaster recovery purposes only - not individual account restores or accidental email deletion (use the Email Archiving feature!). 10 gigabit networking for fast uploads/file sharing.

All CraneMail plans are available in our US (Las Vegas) and EU (Amsterdam) locations.
