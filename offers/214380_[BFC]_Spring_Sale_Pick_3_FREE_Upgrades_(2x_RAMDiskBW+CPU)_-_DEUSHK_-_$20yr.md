### ⚠️ Important Information & Policies (Read Before Buying)

  
**🚫 Restrictions**
> **No Mail/rDNS:** 📧 We do not provide rDNS or email services. TCP Ports 25/465 are blocked.  
> **Port Blocking:** 🛡️ Outbound TCP 22 is blocked by default (Anti-Abuse). UDP 123 is blocked.  
> **Fair Use (CPU):** ⚖️ Fair share policy applies. [Read CPU Policy](https://bitsflow.cloud/cpu.html).

  
📝 **Special Note: Why do we block Outbound TCP Port 22? (Click to expand)**
> When outbound Port 22 is left open, it is often exploited by malicious scripts to initiate brute-force scans against other servers without your knowledge. 🤖 This frequently leads to severe abuse reports and IP blacklisting for both you and us.
>
> By blocking outbound Port 22 by default, we effectively prevent such incidents. **This does NOT affect your normal SSH connection to your VPS.** ✅
>
> If you find this inconvenient or require this specific port for your workflow, simply open a support ticket, and we will happily unblock it for you. 🙂

### 🤒 Feeling like someone is missing?

**You guessed it, the DE-NUE-EPYC node isn't joining in — because it's sick ![:(](https://lowendtalk.com/resources/emoji/frowning.png ":(")**

Due to NIC issues, the **DE-NUE-EPYC** node is currently going through an unstable phase. I have already contacted the upstream provider to replace the network card, which is expected to be completed within 5 days.

Once the DE-NUE-EPYC node has fully recovered 🩹, I will throw a special party just for it right here! 🥳
