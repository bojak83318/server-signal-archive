# OrangeVPS - Summer Sales 2025, Hong Kong Location at Equinix HK1 and Affiliates!
**Link:** [Original Thread](https://lowendtalk.com/discussion/206865/orangevps-summer-sales-2025-hong-kong-location-at-equinix-hk1-and-affiliates)

Introduction
------------

[OrangeVPS](http://orangevps.com/ "OrangeVPS") a newly established web hosting provider launched in 2023. Our prior expertise serves as a solid foundation, enabling us to build a reputation as a customer-focused provider dedicated to excellence.

New Hong Kong Location at Equinix HK1
-------------------------------------

We are expanding our location at **Equinix HK1** by increasing our bandwidth. However, this comes with a trade-off: the latency has approximately doubled. Previously, our latency was around 45-50 ms due to a direct connection with China ISPs. With the new setup at Equinix HK1, we now experience latency levels between 90-110 ms.

The decision to transition to Equinix HK1 stems from the need for a more robust upstream connection. During peak hours, which coincide with typical working hours, we have encountered instances of traffic hiccups and data loss. This expansion aims to enhance our overall performance and reliability, ensuring smoother operations even during high-demand periods.

**Please note**: You may notice that the geolocation of the IP address in our Hong Kong appears to be incorrect. Please be patient as the geolocation providers update their data.
