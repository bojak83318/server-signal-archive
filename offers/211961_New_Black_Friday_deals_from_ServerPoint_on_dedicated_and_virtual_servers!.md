# New Black Friday deals from ServerPoint on dedicated and virtual servers!
**Link:** [Original Thread](https://lowendtalk.com/discussion/211961/new-black-friday-deals-from-serverpoint-on-dedicated-and-virtual-servers)

It's Black Friday week! And also, RAM prices are ridiculously high!

But right now, we have over 200 TB of RAM unused throughout all of our hypervisors and dedicated servers.

Grab these plans before we are forced to pay quadruple the price for RAM and have to raise our prices!

And as a bonus: double your data transfer!
------------------------------------------

Just post your order ID below and our staff will double your monthly data transfer allowance!

Our dedicated servers
=====================

We are looking for a few good clients that will adopt about 40 Supermicro servers that are currently available for sale at our Texas and Nevada data centers. Some features include:

* Remote power cycling
* Redundant network feeds, 1G or 10G
* Redundant power supplies and power feed
* SATA and PCIe solid-state drives
* Data-center-grade servers
* Fully redundant network at all layers
* Up to 10 disks per server
* DDoS protection
