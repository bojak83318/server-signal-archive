FAQ
---

> Why didn't my order deploy?

If your order didn't automatically deploy, it means it was flagged by the system for manual review. We'll review it and get back to you, often times we will push it through unless it's hitting multiple indicators (eg, fraud).

> What's this fraud thing?

If your order was blocked by our fraud checker, just open a ticket and inquire, our staff will look into it. We do not automatically review fraud-flagged orders, only when a ticket is created we will look into it.

> I paid, why does it say it's not paid?

If you paid via Credit Card/Debit Card, and your order is not marked as paid but you see a transaction, that is simply a hold done by the payment processor -- we did not collect your money. Your bank will automatically release that hold, we can't expedite it -- this usually takes anywhere between 3 to 31 business days depending on who you bank with, the average seems to be 3 business days however. You can contact your bank for specifics on when a hold will get released. You should try your payment again, or another payment method (eg, PayPal or Crypto).

> What's the maximum port speed I can get on your High Bandwidth/High Port offerings?

You can get up to 4x100Gbps per machine. There is setup costs associated with the additional ports. If you are colocating multiple units, we support up to 8x100Gbps, with a minimum 40Gbps flat commitment on 8x100Gbps.

> Spain??
