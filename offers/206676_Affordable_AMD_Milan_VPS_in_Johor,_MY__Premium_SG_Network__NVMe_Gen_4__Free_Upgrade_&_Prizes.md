Introducing Affordable AMD Milan VPS in Johor, MY | Premium SG Network | NVMe Gen 4 | Free Upgrade & Prizes ❤️
==============================================================================================================

Hello all, we are glad to be back with another promo on LET! This time, we'd like to share some deals on our newly introduced affordable VPS plans based on AMD EPYC Milan.

If you're not familiar with us, we are Terabix, a startup based in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia with a focus on delivering high-performance, connectivity-driven products that offer exceptional value, backed by a strong focus on customer service.

An overview of our infrastructure and services:

* **Premium Hardware**: Our VPS nodes utilize AMD EPYC Genoa CPUs (Premium) and Milan CPUs (Standard), and are configured with enterprise data center grade, U.2/U.3 Gen4 NVMe in RAID.
* **Premium Network**: Our network consists of a blend of premium transit and IX links, as well as direct connectivity to Equinix SG1 (~1ms).
* **Fully-owned Infrastructure**: We fully own our equipment which is hosted inside of Equinix JH1 and run our own network under AS137552 as an APNIC member.
* **Fully Redundant**: Our infrastructure is fully redundant from power to the network, leaving no room for single points of failure.
