# CHEAP + FAST cloud storage and VPS! Lifetime deals! Amazon S3, NBD, iSCSI, SFTP etc. 10 gbps pipe!

Hi,

I'm offering fast, secure, battle hardened cloud storage at ROCK BOTTOM PRICES!

**I offer Amazon S3, NBD, SFTP, iSCSI, and other alternatives as well.**

**It's only $1.50 per month per terabyte (TB).**

Anyone can afford it!

All files are saved on large **enterprise SAS drives in RAID 1** for ultimate reliability!

My server in Texas has **32 CPU cores and a 10 gbps connection** for ultimate transfer speed!

We use an extremely reputable and reliable data center to maximize uptime.

NBD is a bulletproof technology that hasn't received enough attention.  
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_block_device>

NBD allows you to mount a .img file on a remote server as if it was a local hard drive.

After the .img is mounted, you can save files to it by simply dragging them into the folder!

-

On Linux, you can use nbd-client to mount the .img that lives on my server.

On Windows, you can use <https://cloudbase.it/ceph-on-windows-part-1/> (follow the WNBD instructions)

I haven't seen an nbd client for Mac yet.

-

You should fill your whole NBD image with a VeraCrypt volume: <https://veracrypt.io>

Then, save your files inside of the VeraCrypt volume.

This will ensure that all of your data is encrypted before being sent to my server. I will have no way of looking through your private files!

--

Please do not try to host your files publicly or use up all of the server's bandwidth.

This is a remote storage solution, not a web hosting or file sharing solution.  
Cost, ease of use, and reliability are the main selling points.

You should use at most 100% of your storage in bandwidth per month.   
(so 10 TB of bandwidth per month for a 10 TB storage account)

--

I will store and serve your data in any way you choose!

**LIFETIME DEALS:**

1 TB $150  
5 TB $550 **(EXTREME SAVINGS!)** ![B)](https://lowendtalk.com/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png "B)")   
16 TB $1599
