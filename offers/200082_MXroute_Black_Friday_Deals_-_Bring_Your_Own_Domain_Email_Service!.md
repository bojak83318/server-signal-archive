What's New & Exciting
---------------------

We're working on some cool stuff right now that I'd love to tell you about:

### 1. IP Blacklisting is Dead

We've moved to a smarter system called "susranges." Instead of blanket blocking IPs, we now refuse email from suspicious ranges unless it's authenticated or whitelisted. This means legitimate mail servers in otherwise problematic networks (like Comcast) get through, while spam gets blocked. Win-win-win - no negative impact for users or legit mail servers in those ranges, and typically no more spam. This effort has roughly the same amount of false positives as every other anti-spam effort we've taken over the years, only this plan is designed to reduce the false positives without reducing the spam filtering, a very important change from previous efforts.

### 2. Smarter Spam Fighting

We've deployed Exim ACLs to catch spam trends early in SMTP connections. With our whitelist system, we can now block hundreds of thousands of spam attempts monthly while ensuring legitimate emails get through. No more sacrificing individual cases for "the greater good" - everyone wins!

### 3. UX Improvements

Check out our new DNS page in DirectAdmin on the Glacier server (other servers coming soon) - we've finally made something that was ugly... well, less ugly! [Example Screenshot](https://postimg.cc/KKXd1HF9)

### 4. Faster Compromise Recovery

When your password got compromised in the past, you'd be stuck waiting for us to respond before getting back into your email account. Not anymore! We've automated the recovery process and added proper notification handling for resellers. Now you can get back to business faster when things go wrong.

Looking Forward to 2025
-----------------------

Our goals are simple: better customer experience, streamlined workflows, cleaner interfaces, and the best spam filtering around. And this isn't just talk - we're already seeing success with these improvements right now. If you've ever thought of MXroute as the clunky choice, keep an eye on us this next year (and every day leading up to it - we're not waiting for January)!

Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

### Can I upgrade to one of these promotions?

Yes, but you'll need to handle the migration yourself. We're kind enough to let you do it, but to be sustainable, we don't help with promotional migrations.

### What's that "Hostname" field on the order form?

It's just the initial domain used to set up your account in DirectAdmin. Feel free to use a fake one - just make it obviously fake like thisisntarealdomain.pw.

### How do your sending limits work?

Each email account gets 300 outbound emails per hour. While you can create different email accounts for different purposes, don't try to game the system by creating multiple accounts (like sender1, sender2, etc.) to bypass the 300/hour limit.

### What if you die tomorrow?

What's with everyone wanting me to contemplate my mortality? Look, while I won't claim our succession plan is perfect, we're not a one-man show anymore. If something happens to me, MXroute will be taken care of.

### Can you create a custom promo that fits my needs?

Maybe another time. But if you're hoping for those $5/year deals - those are gone for good. The fees were brutal. The $15 for 3 years is the only way that'll ever come back.

### Can I send transactional email?

Absolutely! That's what most of our customers do anyway. Go for it.

### Can I send marketing email?

No.

### But what if my marketing is...

Still no.
