**Link:** [Original Thread](https://lowendtalk.com/discussion/211640/trending-now-racknerd-s-black-friday-new-deals-new-locations-new-hardware-100-s-of-giveaways)

The countdown is OVER -- welcome to RackNerd’s **OFFICIAL Black Friday 2025** thread! This year marks a turning point. A new generation of hardware, new locations, new perks, and new surprises – all designed to deliver more performance, more value, and more excitement than ever before.

**2025 has been MASSIVE for RackNerd:**  
We expanded our VPS offerings to more locations, rolled out next-gen shared/reseller hosting platform, introduced native IPv6 support to even more datacenter locations, all driven by community feedback right here on LET. Behind the scenes, we added hundreds of new nodes and expanded inventory across KVM VPS, shared, and reseller hosting platforms – helping us keep more stock live during peak demand.

RackNerd continues to accelerate, ranking again among the fastest-growing privately held companies in America by Inc. 5000, and consistently being voted (multiple years in a row) as a top provider by the LET community. None of this is possible without YOU – your trust, reviews, banter, and constant engagement.

And now... it’s time to raise the bar.

This year’s Black Friday lineup features brand-new configurations, fresh nodes, massive bandwidth bonuses, and the highly anticipated return of the legendary **RackNerd Wheel of Fortune**, where you can spin for EXTRA discounts and perks on top of these insane Black Friday prices!

**Buckle up!** This is going to be the **MOST stacked, MOST competitive, MOST intense Black Friday thread** you’ll see on LET in 2025.

Deals, giveaways, surprise drops, hidden flash offers, and nonstop conversation, it all begins right here! Stay tuned -- the giveaway list alone is wild:
