E5-2680 v2 with 256GB RAM for €99/mo (~ $108)
=============================================

Yes. That’s the “wait… is this a typo?” kind of deal.

While RAM pricing is doing its usual chaos, we’ve got this:  
**Dedicated server:**

* 2× Intel® Xeon® E5-2680 v2
* 256 GB RAM
* 8× 600 GB SAS HDD
* €99 / month (~ $108 USD)

**[Order Here](https://my.ava.hosting/order/dedicated-servers/2x-intel-xeon-e5-2680-v2)**

It’s DDR3, but for massive-memory workloads> VMs, huge databases, in-memory caches, heavy multitasking, capacity still wins over generation.
