⚡ Amsterdam VPS, New J Series Launch ⚡
--------------------------------------

In **September**, we experienced a few **downtime incidents** after a long period of stability. As always, we reacted quickly, working relentlessly to resolve every issue as soon as possible.

We carefully reviewed everything, improved what needed optimization, and **further reinforced our network**, ensuring even more reliable service going forward.

Now everything is fully back to normal, with **global connectivity improved even further**, thanks to new peers and direct links with major providers. The result is better consistency, lower latency, and stronger performance.

To mark this new milestone, we are proud to introduce our **brand-new J Series**, now available in **limited stock directly from Amsterdam (AMS)**.

As always, we continue to focus on **stability, reliability, and great value** for everyone.
