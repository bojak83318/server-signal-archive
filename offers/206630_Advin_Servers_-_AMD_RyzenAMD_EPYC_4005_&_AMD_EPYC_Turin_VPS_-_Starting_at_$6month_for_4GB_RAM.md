Please click [here](https://docs.advinservers.com/policies/refund "here") to review the full refund policy including the eligible payment methods and potential fees.
* Please read our Fair Use, Terms of Service, and Privacy Policy before ordering. Running blockchain and/or cryptocurrency-related projects are highly discouraged, please contact us before running one and we can give you an approval.
* We accept any customers from any regions as long as it is legal for us to do so as per United States law. Customers from Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Russia, and Syria are generally not allowed.

**DDoS Mitigation**  
We offer a basic level of DDoS mitigation across all of our locations by default. However, this can only tank basic attacks, and your VPS may be subject to a null route if we receive attacks that start to impact the stability of our network. If you anticipate DDoS attacks, we highly suggest subscribing to our NeoProtect DDoS mitigation at a rate of $4/IP per month, available in Los Angeles, Miami, or Johor, which will provide you with configurable filters. If you would like this addon, please open a ticket.
