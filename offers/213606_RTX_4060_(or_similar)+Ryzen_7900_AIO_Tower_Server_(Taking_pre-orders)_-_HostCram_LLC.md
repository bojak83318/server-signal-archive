Hello Team,

As the title suggests, I plan to build a new GPU + CPU + AIO Liquid-Cooled 10 Gbps Tower server this year. Since we are running on Proxmox, I believe GPU passthrough for VPS will be straightforward.

Below are the specifications I’m currently taking pre-orders for, though I can also provide custom configurations:

Pre-order: GPU + Ryzen 7900 AIO VPS
===================================

• 4× Ryzen 9 7900 Core + GPU access  
• 8 GB DDR5 RAM  
• 80 GB NVMe Storage  
• 40 TB Bandwidth @ 10 Gbps Port  
• 1 Dedicated IPv4

Order here: <https://my.hostcram.com/order/main/packages/special-offers/>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a pre-order only plan.

Expected delivery: March 2026

I already have 192 GB DDR5 RAM and a Ryzen 7900 CPU. Pre-order funds will be used to purchase the remaining parts required to complete the build.

One consideration: I’m still deciding which GPU to use. I can allocate a maximum of 120W for the GPU. I’d appreciate your input and ideas. ![<3](https://lowendtalk.com/resources/emoji/heart.png "<3")
