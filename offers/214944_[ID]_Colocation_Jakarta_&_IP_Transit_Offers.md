Uninet: TATA, NTT, Cogent, HE

Tier 1 is tentative because we follow the provider.

The Indonesian network still needs to connect to Singapore, which is why we have at least three submarine cable systems (SKKL).

* Matrix

* B3JS
* Jakabare
* Indigo
* ASC
* SEAX

Dual-ASN Architecture, We operate two separate ASNs and logic because there are two types of connections: Domestic (IIX) and International (IX). We maintain separate standards because we deliver content to ISPs, requiring redundancy and minimizing errors.
