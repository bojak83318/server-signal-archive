**Link:** [Original Thread](https://lowendtalk.com/discussion/211404/11-11-sales-actually-the-12th-cheapest-dedis-in-new-zealand-1)

Hi There!

First time posting an offer thread since the “Patron” tag was introduced here on LET, so please go easy on me.

Thread tittle says "11.11 Sales" but here in New Zealand 🇳🇿, we kinda live in the future and its the 12th already ![:D](https://lowendtalk.com/resources/emoji/lol.png ":D")

I’m not quite the marketing pro unlike some of the other providers here, so let’s skip the flashy intros and get straight to an offer the LET crowd will find hard to refuse!

Our dedicated servers include VPN’d IPMI access and optional free BGP sessions if you’ve got your own ASN or IP space. You can check out our [Looking Glass here](https://lg-nz.zappiehost.com/ "[Looking Glass here]").

Dedicated servers are provisioned within 24-48 hours of payment, we have fairly limited stock of these, so get in quick!  
And if these dedis a little too beefy you’re always welcome to check out our VPS lineup

Now, what’s so special about New Zealand?

* Contrary to popular belief, we’re not part of Australia. We actually have better latency to North America than they do.
* We’ve got the best rugby team in the world. GO THE ALL BLACKS!
* We have a lot of sheep. Something like 5 x our population
* A timezone that means your 3 AM alerts hit someone else’s working hours.
* And yes, it’s the only place where your server can genuinely claim to live in Middle-earth
