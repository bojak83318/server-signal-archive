Why Isolation Matters
---------------------

The biggest mistake people make with AI agents is running them next to sensitive environments:

* Personal and production files
* API tokens and private keys
* Password managers
* Email accounts
* Browser sessions
* Messaging apps

OpenClaw is not just another app.  
It is an agent that performs actions.

If permissions or integrations are misconfigured, the impact can become very real.

---

The Safer Approach
------------------

Run OpenClaw inside a dedicated environment.

A separate machine means:

* Lower risk of credential leaks
* Isolated API keys and services
* Full control over integrations
* 24/7 availability
* Clear separation from personal or business infrastructure
