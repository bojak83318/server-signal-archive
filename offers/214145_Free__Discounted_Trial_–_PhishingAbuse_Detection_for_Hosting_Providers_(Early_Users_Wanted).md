# Free / Discounted Trial – Phishing/Abuse Detection for Hosting Providers (Early Users Wanted)
**Link:** [Original Thread](https://lowendtalk.com/discussion/214145/free-discounted-trial-phishing-abuse-detection-for-hosting-providers-early-users-wanted)

Hi everyone,

We’re opening a free / discounted early trial for Scantra for Hosting Providers, a phishing-detection platform.

What it does (briefly):

[+] Continuously monitors customer-hosted domains & websites

[+] Detects phishing pages before abuse reports, blacklisting, or legal escalation

[+] Helps reduce abuse tickets, IP reputation damage, and takedown overhead

Why we’re offering this trial:  
We’re onboarding a limited number of hosting providers to:

[+] Validate detection accuracy at scale

[+] Get real-world feedback from operators

[+] Fine-tune provider workflows (alerts, response time, false positives)

Trial details:

[+] Free or heavily discounted (case-by-case)

[+] No long-term commitment

[+] Best suited for shared hosting, VPS, cloud, or registrar platforms

If you operate or manage a hosting network and want early access, DM me and I’ll share details.

Regards,

Scantra.org
