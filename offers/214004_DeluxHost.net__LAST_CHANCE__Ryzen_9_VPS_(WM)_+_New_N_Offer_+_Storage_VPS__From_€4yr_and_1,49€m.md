# DeluxHost.net | LAST CHANCE | Ryzen 9 VPS (W/M) + New N Offer + Storage VPS | From €4/yr and 1,49€/m
**Link:** [Original Thread](https://lowendtalk.com/discussion/214004/deluxhost-net-last-chance-ryzen-9-vps-w-m-new-n-offer-storage-vps-from-4-yr-and-1-49-m)

🔔 Important Update & Special Offers (Last Chance)
=================================================

We want to be direct.

**We understand the frustration, anger, and disappointment** many of you expressed after the recent price increase.  
It was not an easy decision.

We know we disappointed part of the community.  
We don’t deny it.

For this reason, we immediately started working on ways to **partially make up for our mistake**.  
As already communicated via email, we began granting **bonuses to customers who had already purchased**, with the goal of adding **extra value to their servers**.

So far, **over 400 tickets have already been opened**, and we expect many more.  
We are aware this process is demanding, but we believe that this effort can **at least partially compensate for what happened**, by giving customers something concrete back.

---

⚠️ About These Offers
---------------------

At the same time, we had promised that there would be **one or two final chances** to access our services at prices **similar to the previous ones**.

This offer is **one of those chances**.

We **cannot guarantee** that there will be another one after this.  
Availability will depend entirely on **hardware and remaining capacity**.

The goal is simple:  
to allow those who **did not manage to purchase at the old prices** to do so now, **one last time**.

---

⚠️ IMPORTANT – PLEASE READ CAREFULLY
------------------------------------

* Prices for **VPS (N, W, M)** are valid **ONLY for the first year**
* These offers are **NOT recurring**
* At renewal, the **standard price** will apply
* Renewal prices are **explicitly shown in the tables**
* **Storage VPS are excluded**: monthly billing, price **does not change**

---

An Honest Message
-----------------

We know that some users complained about performance, others experienced technical issues, and others lost trust.  
That is understandable.

In a short time, we went from being a **very small hosting provider** to a steadily growing operation.  
We are not big yet, but we grow month after month, and that also brings real challenges.

It’s not easy to satisfy everyone.  
What we can say with certainty is this: **we work every day to improve**.

Trust is not demanded.  
**It is rebuilt.**
