F.A.Q.
------

Q. How long will my server take to be delivered?  
A. Instant buy servers are instant on payment. Target for servers which require RAM or disk modifications will take up to 24 hours. If the Base model/CPU is not listed under instant buy the lead time may be longer.  
Q. Do you ignore DCMA complaints.  
A. Upon DCMA we give you 72 hours to acknowledge and confirm action before suspension. As long as complaints are not excessive, no further action will be taken.  
Q. Can I use these servers for scanning or attacks?  
A. This activity generates abuse complaints. If you do not resolve these then you may get permeant suspension.  
Q. Can I use for Streaming?  
A. As long as there is no copyright infringement then yes. We detect IP's with unusual traffic peaks during major sporting events, and bandwidth may be restricted pending your response if traffic rises during these events beyond normal levels.  
Q. Can I bring my own IP's, ASN or have BGP  
A. Yes! With your own IP's you also can manage your own abuse complaints reducing the risk of suspension.
