👻 **VM6 Halloween Hunt — Win a Free UK VPS for a Year!** 👻  
This Halloween, the VM6 Networks website has been haunted… by 12 tiny ghosts hiding in the shadows of our pages. We’re giving away the prizes below to the first brave souls who can find them!

**How it works:**  
- Somewhere across vm6.co.uk, four small ghosts are lurking.  
- If you spot one, take a screenshot and be the first to post it here on this thread.  
- Clicking on the ghost will tell you what prize you have won from down below.  
- Each Ghost can only be claimed once — first come, first scream.  
- One prize per participant — no double haunting!  
- VPS will still be subject to our Policies and Terms of Service.  
- Please play fair no automations etc.

**Prizes to be Won:**  
- 5 x UK AMD VPS 1 - FREE for 1 year  
- 2 x UK AMD VPS 2 - FREE for 6 Months  
- 5 x £5 Account Credit   
- 2 x £10 Account Credit  
- 1 x £20 Account Credit

But beware… these ghosts are really small and well-hidden. You’ll need sharp eyes to uncover them. This won’t be easy — only the most persistent hunters will survive the search!

So sharpen your senses, dim the lights, and start hunting. The pumpkins won’t stay hidden forever…

Happy haunting,

— Rob @ VM6 Networks
