# OrangeVPS needs your help to test our servers
**Link:** [Original Thread](https://lowendtalk.com/discussion/196974/orangevps-needs-your-help-to-test-our-servers)

We are OrangeVPS, a hosting provider with servers located in Singapore and a primary upstream connection through Hurricane Electric. We would like to invite you to participate in a 3 days server test.

For this test, we are offering a total of 25 VPS (virtual private servers) - one VPS per participant. You are welcome to leverage these servers to fulfill your hosting needs during the 3 days period. However, we do not permit the use of bots, crypto mining, spam, or any other activities that violate our terms of service or applicable laws. During the test, we will monitor all activity on the servers to ensure the health and integrity of our infrastructure. Please be sure to back up any important data, as the servers will be terminated after the 3 days period.

Your participation in this test will provide valuable insights that will help us tailor our offerings to better serve the VPSs. As a token of our appreciation, we will provide you with a discount coupon that can be used on your registered email address after the test is complete. We look forward to your participation and the opportunity to work with you. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to us.
