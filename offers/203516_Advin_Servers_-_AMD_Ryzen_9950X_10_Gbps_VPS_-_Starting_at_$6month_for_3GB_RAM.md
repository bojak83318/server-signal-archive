* We've been in business for nearly 5 years. We own all of our hardware, and have our own racks across locations such as Los Angeles, Miami, Kansas City, Nuremberg, and Johor.
* All of our Ryzen servers are liquid-cooled, and we ensure that the processors are able to boost to their maximum clocks (5.7 GHz). We do not artificially limit the TDP to ensure maximum performance.
* We use Enterprise NVMe drives in redundant RAID configurations across every VPS host node, ensuring that your data is kept as safe as possible.
* Nearly all new virtual machines are backed up daily, and 5 days worth of backups are kept (best-effort, not guaranteed). Included for free with every service.
* We use extremely well-connected networks in locations such as Los Angeles, Miami, Nuremberg, and Johor, all of which are upstreamed by premium DDoS-protected network providers such as CDN77 (<https://lg.advinservers.com/>).
