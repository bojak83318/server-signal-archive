Dear LET Community,

Our **30% discount for 3 months** offering on Amsterdam Dedicated Servers is still active — but it will be ending soon.

Due to the strong demand and hardware cost increases, we would like to remind LET members that this exclusive offer will not last much longer. If you’ve been considering deploying in the Amsterdam - Netherlands, now is the time to secure your server before the promotion concludes.

server.net maintains full ownership of all servers, routers, and infrastructure hardware. Our Amsterdam services are delivered directly from Digital Realty AMS17 Science Park, one of Europe’s most connected data center hubs.

All servers are in stock, ready for immediate deployment. We do user verification checks (KYC) via Stripe.

This 30% discount is valid for the first three months and is limited to available stock. The offer remains restricted to one server per customer or organization.
