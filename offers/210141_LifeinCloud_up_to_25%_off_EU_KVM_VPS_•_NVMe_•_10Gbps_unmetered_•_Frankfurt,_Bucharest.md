# LifeinCloud: up to 25% off EU KVM VPS • NVMe • 10Gbps unmetered • Frankfurt, Bucharest
**Link:** [Original Thread](https://lowendtalk.com/discussion/210141/lifeincloud-up-to-25-off-eu-kvm-vps-nvme-10gbps-unmetered-frankfurt-bucharest)

Hello everyone,

Following the success of our sub-brand LumaDock with the LET community, we decided to also post an offer for our main brand: [LifeinCloud](https://lifeincloud.com/ "LifeinCloud"). So who are we?

We’re an independent, European cloud provider running our own hardware across multiple European zones. We have our own data center in Bucharest with additional Tier III+ availability zones in London (Netwise East), Frankfurt (Firstcolo R3) and Paris (DC2SCALE PAR3). ISO-27001 and GDPR-compliant.

For business customers, we provide [open-source private cloud](https://lifeincloud.com/private-cloud-infrastructure "open-source private cloud") solutions and [managed IT services](https://lifeincloud.com/managed-services "managed IT services").

For VPS customers, we run enterprise-grade Intel Xeon Gold nodes with NVMe storage and in-house 24/7 support. At the time of this promo, only **Frankfurt** and **Bucharest** locations are available, with the other ones either out of stock or coming later this year.

We own our hardware. We don't charge setup fees or surprise fees.
