📌 Notes for Server Deployments:

Instant provision servers typically deploy within approximately 15 minutes, depending on the selected operating system. (Windows Server is only available BYO License at this time).

Custom-built / storage servers generally take between 12-72 hours for deployment, based on hardware availability and configuration requirements.
