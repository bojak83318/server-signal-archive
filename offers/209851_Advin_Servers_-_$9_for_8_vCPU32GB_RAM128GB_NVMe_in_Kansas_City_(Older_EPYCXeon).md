**Introduction**  
We've launched a new KVM Budget VPS in our Kansas City, MO location. This offering may come to some of our other locations in the future, but we don't have an ETA.

**KVM Budget XS**  
Randomized CPU (8 vCPU)  
32GB DDR4 ECC Memory  
128GB NVMe SSD Storage  
5TB Bandwidth (10 Gbps)  
Located in Kansas City, MO  
[$9/month](https://advinservers.com/cloud "$9/month")

**CPU**

For this lineup, we don't guarantee any particular processor. Currently, new plans are being deployed on AMD EPYC Rome processors, but we have future plans to bring Xeon processors to this lineup. Obviously, we are using power-efficient and older processors so don't expect the best performance in comparison to our other lineups.

If you're not happy with the performance, we offer automatic refunds back to account credit within 72 hours as long as you request an instant cancellation - and you can use this credit toward any of our other lineups such as our KVM Standard, KVM Premium, KVM Extreme, or KVM Ryzen VPS which uses much better processors and has significantly better performance.
