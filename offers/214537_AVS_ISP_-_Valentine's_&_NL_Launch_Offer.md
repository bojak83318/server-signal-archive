UK downstreams must be Single-Homed (upstream policy) or their prefixes may stop being announced by our upstream (this applies to UK ONLY - not other locations). BGP sessions are for you own ASN and IPs only, not downstreams.
* BYOIP on our ASN also possible - submit a ticket to get this setup - requires valid IRR and RPKI setup on your prefixes - can be routed directly to your VM.
* Automatic setup within 5 minutes (with standard specs - double specs requires posting VM ID here and manual upgrade)

* rDNS setup available - simply submit a ticket.
* IPv6 SWIP (your info on WHOIS / abuse contact possible). IPv4 SWIP possible on Albania only. Ask in ticket if needed.

Abuse & Policy Notes
--------------------

* No KYC - only valid email address and a chosen display name is required.
* Port 25 SMTP blocked by default - only unblocked by ticket request and only for legitimate personal / business mail servers with matching rDNS setup - will be blocked back if any suspicion of spamming. If ordering for a mail server, please send a ticket BEFORE adding credit or ordering to avoid issues should we not approve port unblock.
* We do not inspect customer VMs or files - privacy is guaranteed
* Legitimate abuse complaints from reputable sources with proof will result in suspension and a ticket to confirm or dispute. Confirmation or lack of reply will result in termination. Please ensure you have a valid email on file to receive such notifications.
* Criminal activity will result in immediate termination without refund (with proof - not simply a random report with no proof).

For double specs, order before Feb 15th 23:59 UTC and post your VM ID here.

HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY! ![<3](https://lowendtalk.com/resources/emoji/heart.png "<3")
