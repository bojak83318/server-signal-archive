Hello again LET!

Thank you all for the feedback from the previous topic! This time around we tried to make things clearer and more exciting.

But for those of you hearing about us for the first time: We’re [LumaDock](https://lumadock.com/ "LumaDock"), a European VPS provider built and operated by the team behind [LifeinCloud](https://lifeincloud.com/ "LifeinCloud"). Since 2009, we've been building and managing infrastructure - for ourselves as well for our managed services clients.  
. We own our hardware and run our own datacenter in Bucharest. We don’t resell, we don’t overprovision and we don’t add setup/surprise fees. Our 24/7 support is in-house, done by people who know infrastructure - not outsourced call centers. But now with housekeeping out of the way, let's get to the big news...

Frankfurt, Germany VPS zone is live!

We’re thrilled to announce that our new Frankfurt, Germany zone is officially open for deployments! Housed inside firstcolo's state-of-the-art FRA1/R3 Tier III data center, right next to DE-CIX (the world’s largest Internet exchange), this location brings low latency to Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Benelux and much of Central Europe.
