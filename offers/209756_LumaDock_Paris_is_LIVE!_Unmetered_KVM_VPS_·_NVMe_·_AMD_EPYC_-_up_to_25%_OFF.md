Hello again LET!

For anyone new to us: we’re LumaDock, a European VPS platform built and operated by the team behind [LifeinCloud](https://lifeincloud.com/ "LifeinCloud"). Since 2009 we’ve been building and running infrastructure for ourselves and for managed-services clients (as well as a B2B [open-source private cloud](https://lifeincloud.com/private-cloud-infrastructure "open-source private cloud")). We own our hardware, operate our own datacenter in Bucharest, and we don’t resell, overprovision, or add setup/surprise fees. Support is 24/7, multi-lingual and fully in-house.

Paris, France VPS zone is live!
===============================

Our new Paris zone is now open for deployments. It’s hosted in a Tier III design facility and runs on **AMD EPYC** with fast NVMe storage and unmetered bandwidth. Great choice if your users sit in France and neighboring countries.
