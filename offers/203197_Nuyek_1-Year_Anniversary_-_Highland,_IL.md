# Nuyek 1-Year Anniversary - Highland, IL
**Link:** [Original Thread](https://lowendtalk.com/discussion/203197/nuyek-1-year-anniversary-highland-il)

🎉 Celebrating 1 year as a provider! 🎉
=====================================

Thank You for Being a Part of Our Journey!
------------------------------------------

We are thrilled to celebrate our first anniversary a provider. Your support has been amazing, and we look forward to serving you for many more years!

Really, thank you! The first few months were quite rocky, with uptime ranging from 95% to 98%. However, it has vastly improved, hovering between 99.5% and 99.9% over the past two months.

Here's some new features we've added:

* Pay multiple invoices at once
* Pay manually with saved payment methods on file instead of only during invoice generation ( Credit/Debit cards ). Can also use credit manually as well.
* Cart system rewrite
* Cart reservation system
* Daily flash sales
* Traffic usage available in dedicated control panel
* Core network re-designed to support greater capacities and reliability
* Small additions to affiliate system

Here's some stuff we're working on:

* Automatic BGP sessions ( in testing! )

Please use our looking glass [here](https://lg.nuyek.com "Looking Glass") to test our network. We offer a 7-Day Refund Policy and I wish to keep it that way. I'm a bit tired of refunding people who don't read and ruin it for other people who wish to try my service. Otherwise I'm more then happy to continue!
