# Aepto Public Beta – Centralized Domain, DNS & Infrastructure Monitoring (Win Free Subscription)
**Link:** [Original Thread](https://lowendtalk.com/discussion/213347/aepto-public-beta-centralized-domain-dns-infrastructure-monitoring-win-free-subscription)

Hey LET 👋

If you manage domains across multiple registrars, you probably know the pain 😅  
Missed renewals, broken DNS, email issues, or something going down without you noticing.

That’s what we’re building **Aepto** for.

🌐 Website: <https://aepto.com>  
🎥 Overview video: [![](https://img.youtube.com/vi/6bOxraaC6GE/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bOxraaC6GE)

(The video gives a quick visual overview of what Aepto does and how it works.)

---

What Aepto is 🧠
---------------

Aepto is a single platform to **centralize monitoring and management of your domains, DNS, email, and infrastructure**, regardless of where they are registered or hosted.

You add a domain and Aepto automatically scans publicly available data.  
❌ No APIs  
❌ No account connections  
❌ No provider restrictions

If something is detected incorrectly (for example with resellers or custom setups), you can manually override it.

### Additional note

Aepto is a product by **Limitless Hosting**, and is being actively developed as part of our broader infrastructure and monitoring ecosystem.

This is an early beta ⚠️  
Some detections rely on public data and may not always be perfect, but everything is editable and improvements are shipping quickly.

Thanks 🙌
