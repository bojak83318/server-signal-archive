**Link:** [Original Thread](https://lowendtalk.com/discussion/204684/hostbrr-two-year-anniversary-deals-amd-epyc-turin-block-storage-flash-deals)

Hello LET,

HostBrr can now celebrate two years in business!

Much has happened in just two years - and much has improved. HostBrr to this day has remained true to the core values of making hosting go Brr! Not only is the goal to deliver some of the best performance available but also to offer this at very affordable pricing. This trend now continues by introducing offers based on latest generation AMD EPYC Turin CPUs, boasting an incredible generational boost compared to AMD EPYC Genoa.

Large HDD Block storage is also available for these servers (Up to 20 TB blocks available)!
