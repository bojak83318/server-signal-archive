Notes on Billing:
-----------------

Our system attempts automatic payments one day before the due date and applies prorated billing for services ordered on or after the 10th which then will include the full next month. Please ensure timely payment to avoid immediate service suspension on the due date and permanent termination after three days. Due to the low price of these plans, we have a strict 3-day termination policy for unpaid invoices.

FUP Explained:
--------------

To ensure optimal performance for all clients, our shared infrastructure requires fair usage of resources. While bandwidth is unmetered and CPU is burstable, you may not continuously saturate network ports or run the CPU at maximum capacity 24/7. High-load activities such as crypto mining, CDNs, and continuous streaming are strictly prohibited, and we reserve the right to limit or suspend services that negatively impact other users.
