# Hetzner EX63 FreeBSD 16.0-CURRENT ZFS Dedicated Server Share, Helsinki
**Link:** [Original Thread](https://lowendtalk.com/discussion/213960/hetzner-ex63-freebsd-16-0-current-zfs-dedicated-server-share-helsinki)

**Hetzner EX63 Server Share**

[Depenguin.me](https://depenguin.me) helped me get [FreeBSD](https://Freebsd.org) installed on a [Hetzner EX63.](https://www.hetzner.com/dedicated-rootserver/ex63/)

The server is being used to self-compile and enjoy FreeBSD 16.0-CURRENT with ZFS.

It's my first time with ZFS! It's *almost* my first time with FreeBSD!

Does anyone want a [MetalVPS](https://metalvps.com) EX63 shell account on FreeBSD 16.0-CURRENT with ZFS?

Best wishes!

Tom
